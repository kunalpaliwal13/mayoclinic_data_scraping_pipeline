Overview
Short bowel syndrome is a condition in which the body cannot absorb enough nutrients from foods because part of the small intestine is missing or damaged.
The small intestine is where most of the nutrients you eat are absorbed into your body during digestion.
Short bowel syndrome can happen when:
- Parts of the small intestine have been surgically removed.Conditions that may require surgical removal of large portions of the small intestine include Crohn's disease, cancer, traumatic injuries and blood clots in the arteries that provide blood to the intestines.
- Portions of the small intestine are missing or damaged at birth.Babies may be born with a short small intestine or with a damaged small intestine that must be surgically removed.
Short bowel syndrome treatment typically involves special diets and nutritional supplements. It may involve receiving nutrition through a vein, called parenteral nutrition, to prevent malnutrition.
