Prevention
Get thevaccine to help prevent genital warts. And if you have sex, limit your number of partners. It's safest to have sex with just one partner who only has sex with you. It's also a good idea to use a condom every time you have sex. But this won't fully protect you from genital warts. That's becausecan infect parts of the body that the condom doesn't cover.
Vaccination
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends routinevaccination for girls and boys ages 11 and 12. But the vaccine can be given as early as age 9.
It's ideal for children to receive the vaccine before they have sexual contact.
Most often, side effects from the vaccines are mild. They include soreness where the shot was given, headaches, a low-grade fever or flu-like symptoms.
Thenow recommends that all 11- and 12-year-olds receive two doses ofvaccine 6 to 12 months apart. The agency used to recommend a three-dose schedule. Younger children ages 9 and 10 and teens ages 13 and 14 also can get two doses of the vaccine. Research has shown that two doses work for children under 15.
Teens and young adults who start the vaccine series later, at ages 15 through 26, should receive three doses. Therecommends that the second dose be given 1 to 2 months after the first. The third dose should be given 6 months after the first.
Thenow recommends catch-upvaccinations for all people through age 26 who aren't fully vaccinated.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the Gardasil 9vaccine for males and females ages 9 to 45. If you're ages 27 to 45, ask your health care team about your risks to decide if you should get thevaccine.
Othervaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk with your health care team about when to get vaccinated and how many doses are needed.
