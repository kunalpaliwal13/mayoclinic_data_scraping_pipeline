Overview
Synovial sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that tends to occur near large joints, mainly the knees. Synovial sarcoma usually affects young adults.
Synovial sarcoma begins as a growth of cells that can multiply quickly and destroy healthy tissue. The first symptom is usually swelling or a lump under the skin. The lump may or may not hurt.
Synovial sarcoma can occur almost anywhere in the body. The most common places are in the legs and arms.
Synovial sarcoma is a type of cancer called a soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma happens in the body's connective tissues. There are many types of soft tissue sarcoma.

When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that don't go away and that worry you.
Causes
It's not clear what causes synovial sarcoma.
This kind of cancer forms when cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.
Risk factors
Younger age is a risk factor for synovial sarcoma. This cancer happens most often in older children and young adults.
There is no way to prevent synovial sarcoma.
