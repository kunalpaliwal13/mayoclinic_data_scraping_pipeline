Symptoms
Symptoms of ulnar wrist pain may include:
- Pain that worsens when gripping something or twisting the wrist.
- Loss of strength when trying to grip firmly.
- Trouble moving the wrist or rotating the forearm.
- A popping or clicking sound when moving the wrist.
Causes
Because so many factors can lead to wrist pain, it can be difficult to diagnose. Common causes of ulnar wrist pain include:
- Sudden impacts.A common cause of wrist injuries is a fall onto an outstretched hand. This can cause sprains, strains and even fractures.
- Repetitive stress.Any activity that involves wrist motion done over and over can inflame the tissues around the joint or cause stress fractures. The risk of injury is increased when you perform the movement for hours on end without a break.
- Arthritis.This can cause swelling and stiffness in the wrist. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis can cause wrist pain.
Risk factors
Sports participation, repetitive work, and certain diseases and conditions can put you at risk for ulnar wrist pain.
- Sports participation.Wrist injuries are common in many sports, both those that involve impact and those that put repetitive stress on the wrist. These can include football, golf, tennis and pickleball.
- Repetitive work.People who regularly use a computer mouse or keyboard are at risk. Carpenters and plumbers may develop ulnar wrist pain because they often use tools in small spaces, causing awkward positioning of the wrist.
- Other diseases and conditions.People with generally loose ligaments, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout also are at risk.
