Overview
Median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, happens when the band of tissue in the upper belly area presses on the artery that sends blood to the stomach, spleen and liver. This tissue is called the median arcuate ligament. The artery is called the celiac artery.
The median arcuate ligament creates a pathway between the chest and belly area for the body's main blood vessel, called the aorta. Typically, the ligament goes across the aorta. The celiac artery sits just below the arch.
But sometimes, the ligament or arteries may be out of place. The ligament may put pressure on the celiac artery and the network of surrounding nerves, called the celiac plexus. This pressure can cause the symptoms of. The condition can cause serious stomach pain in some people.
can occur in anyone, even children. Other names forare:
- Celiac artery compression syndrome.
- Celiac axis syndrome.
- Dunbar syndrome.
Treatment involves surgery to release pressure from the ligament on the artery and nerves.
Symptoms
Pressure on the celiac artery doesn't always cause symptoms.symptoms are mainly caused by pressure on the nerves.
Symptoms ofinclude:
- Stomach pain after eating or exercising.
- The stomach pain gets better by leaning forward or backward or standing while eating.

Risk factors
Because the cause ofis poorly understood, the risk factors are unclear. Median arcuate ligament syndrome is more common in adults than in children. It also is more common among women than among men.
also has been seen in identical twins, so genetics may play a role.
Some people have developed median arcuate ligament syndrome after pancreatic surgery or blunt injury to the upper stomach area.
Complications
A complication of median arcuate ligament syndrome, also called MALS, is long-term pain, especially after meals. The pain can lead to a fear of eating and significant weight loss. The pain and related depression or anxiety can greatly impact quality of life.symptoms may be vague. The symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions.
