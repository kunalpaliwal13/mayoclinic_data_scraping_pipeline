Overview
Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in an oil gland in the skin. Sebaceous carcinoma most often affects the eyelids.
Sebaceous carcinoma may begin as a painless lump or thickening of skin on the eyelid. On other parts of the body, it might cause a bump on the skin that may bleed or have a scab.
Sebaceous carcinoma treatment often involves surgery to remove the cancer. Sebaceous carcinoma can grow quickly and sometimes spreads to other parts of the body.

Causes
The cause of sebaceous carcinoma often isn't known. This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the oil-producing glands of the skin. These glands are called sebaceous glands.
Sebaceous carcinoma happens when sebaceous gland cells get changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells form a growth or lump on the skin.
Risk factors
Risk factors for sebaceous carcinoma include:
- Weakened immune system.If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medicine or illness, there might be a higher risk of sebaceous carcinoma. People with weakened immune systems include those taking medicine to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. Some health conditions, such as HIV infection, also can weaken the immune system.
- Radiation therapy.People who received radiation therapy treatments for cancer may have a higher risk of sebaceous carcinoma.
- Older age.Sebaceous carcinoma happens most often in people over age 60.
- Hereditary syndromes.People with some conditions that run in families may be more likely to have sebaceous carcinoma. Examples include Lynch syndrome and Muir-Torre syndrome.
There is no way to prevent sebaceous carcinoma.
