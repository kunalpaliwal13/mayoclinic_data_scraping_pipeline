Overview
Rectal prolapse happens when the rectum slips out of the anus and can be seen outside the body. While rectal prolapse may cause pain, it's rarely a medical emergency.
Rectal prolapse is sometimes treated with stool softeners, suppositories and other medicines. But surgery is usually needed to treat rectal prolapse.
