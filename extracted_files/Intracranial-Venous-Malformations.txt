Overview
Intracranial venous malformations are veins in the brain that are unusually large. These larger veins aren't likely to cause symptoms or affect how the veins work.
Some people may have an intracranial venous malformation that is never diagnosed and never causes symptoms. Sometimes, they're found by accident during a brain imaging test for another condition.
Intracranial venous malformations usually don't require treatment.

When to see a doctor
Seek medical attention if you have any of the symptoms of an intracranial venous malformation.
Causes
Experts don't understand what causes intracranial venous malformations. Certain genetic changes might play a role, and the malformations may happen during fetal development. However, some types may not be inherited and are acquired later in life, possibly after an injury to the central nervous system.
Risk factors
Having a family history of intracranial venous malformations can increase your risk. But most types aren't inherited.
Certain hereditary conditions can increase your risk of intracranial venous malformations. These include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.
