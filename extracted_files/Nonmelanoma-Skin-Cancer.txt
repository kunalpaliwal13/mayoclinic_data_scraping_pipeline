Overview
Nonmelanoma skin cancer refers to all the types of cancer that happen in the skin that are not melanoma.
Several types of skin cancer fall within the broader category of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Almost all nonmelanoma skin cancers are either basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Other types of nonmelanoma skin cancer are rare.
Nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment depends on the type of cancer. Skin cancer treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer cells.

Symptoms
Symptoms of nonmelanoma skin cancer often develop on parts of the body that are exposed to the sun. Examples include the scalp, face, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands. But nonmelanoma skin cancer can happen on other parts of the body too. This includes the lips, fingers, fingernails and genital areas.
Nonmelanoma skin cancer symptoms appear as a change in the skin, including:
- A new growth on the skin.
- Changes to an existing skin spot, such as changes in shape or color.
- Itching, pain, crusting or bleeding of a skin spot.
- A sore that won't heal or one that keeps coming back.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you see any changes on your skin that worry you.
Causes
Nonmelanoma skin cancer develops when changes happen in the DNA of skin cells. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA tells the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. The DNA also tells the cells to die at a set time.
In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. In nonmelanoma skin cancer, the cells grow out of control and may form a new growth on the skin or cause changes in an existing spot on the skin.
Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, causes most of the DNA changes in skin cells. UV light can come from sunlight, tanning lamps and tanning beds. But sun exposure doesn't explain skin cancers that develop on skin that's not typically exposed to sunlight. Other factors can contribute to the risk and development of nonmelanoma skin cancer. The exact cause is not always clear.
Risk factors
Factors that may raise the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer include:
- Being in the sun too much.A lot of time spent in the sun or using tanning beds raises the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Getting severe sunburns also raises the risk.
- Having skin that sunburns easily.Anyone of any skin color can get nonmelanoma skin cancer. But it's more common in people who have low levels of melanin in their skin. Melanin is a substance that gives color to skin. It also helps protect the skin from damaging UV light. People with Black or brown skin have more melanin than people with white skin. The risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer is highest in people who have blond or red hair, have light-colored eyes, and freckle or sunburn easily.
- A personal or family history of skin cancer.People who have had skin cancer before have a higher risk of developing it again. Those with a family history of skin cancer also may have a higher risk of developing nonmelanoma skin cancer.
- Medicines to control the immune system.Medicines that work by suppressing the immune system raise the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancers significantly. Medicines that work in this way include those used after an organ transplant to prevent rejection.
- Radiation therapy.Radiation therapy to treat acne or other skin conditions may raise the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer at the previous treatment sites on the skin.
- Increasing age.The risk of some types of nonmelanoma skin cancer goes up as people get older.
- Inherited syndromes that cause skin cancer.Some rare genetic diseases can raise the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer.
