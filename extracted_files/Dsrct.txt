Overview
Desmoplastic (des-moe-PLAS-tik) small round cell tumors (DSRCT) are a type of cancer that often begins in the abdomen. Sometimes this type of cancer can occur in other parts of the body.
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are rare cancers that begin as a growth of cells. The growths often form on the tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. This tissue lining is called the peritoneum. The cancer cells can quickly spread to other nearby organs. This might include the bladder, colon and liver.
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors can happen to anyone, but they're more common in young men and boys.
Treatment for desmoplastic small round cell tumors typically involves a combination of treatments. Options might include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are a type of soft tissue sarcoma. Soft tissue sarcoma is a term used to describe a large group of cancers that all start in the tissues that connect, support and surround other body structures.

This creates a clump of cancer cells called a tumor. The cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.
