Overview
Rheumatoid arthritis is an ongoing, called chronic, condition that causes pain, swelling and irritation, called inflammation, in the joints. But it also can damage other parts of the body. These may include the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels.
Rheumatoid arthritis happens when the immune system attacks its own body's tissues by mistake. This is called an autoimmune condition.
Rheumatoid arthritis differs from the more common osteoarthritis. Some people have both. Osteoarthritis causes damage to joints from overuse. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of the joints and eats away at the bone under them. This causes a painful swelling that can cause joints to bend out of shape over time, called deformity.
The inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis also can damage other parts of the body. New medicines have improved treatment choices greatly. But rheumatoid arthritis still can cause long-term damage and increase the risk of heart disease.

Symptoms
Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:
- Painful, warm, swollen joints.
- Joint stiffness that most often is worse in the mornings and after periods of rest. It can last for 45 minutes or longer.
- Tiredness, fever and not wanting to eat.
Rheumatoid arthritis may affect just a few joints at first. Most often, these are the small joints of the hands and the feet.
As the disease gets worse, symptoms may spread to more joints. These most often include the wrists, elbows, hips, knees and ankles. Most of the time, symptoms affect the same joints on both sides of the body.
Many people who have rheumatoid arthritis also have symptoms that affect more than the joints. Areas that may be affected include:
- Skin.
- Eyes.
- Lungs.
- Heart.
- Nerve tissue.
- Blood.
Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms may vary in how bad they are. They may come and go. Periods when the condition becomes more active, called flares, follow periods of less or no swelling and pain. This is called remission.
Over time, rheumatoid arthritis can cause joints to bend out of shape and shift out of place. The joints can be hard to use for daily activities at home or at work.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing pain and swelling in your joints that is not getting better after several weeks.
Vivien Williams:Pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints — all are symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. But because these symptoms come and go, the condition can sometimes be tricky to diagnose. And it's important to get the right diagnosis because starting treatment early can make a difference.
Virginia Wimmer, has rheumatoid arthritis:Give me your best shot!
Ms. Williams:At first, Virginia Wimmer blamed her painful joints on too much volleyball.
Ms. Wimmer:In my knees and in my wrists.
Ms. Williams:For a couple years, she put up with the pain and swelling that would come and go. Then things got much worse.
Ms. Wimmer:I couldn't have a ball touch my arms.
Ms. Williams:She couldn't do much of anything, let alone play outside with her daughter.
Ms. Wimmer:That was really hard. She'd have to beg me to play with her, and teach her, and help her. And I just had to sit and watch.
Ms. Williams:Virginia was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.
Nisha Manek, M.D., Rheumatology, Mayo Clinic:Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory condition. It's also associated with the immune system.
Ms. Williams:Dr. Nisha Manek says it happens when the immune system becomes deregulated. You see, the joint capsule has a lining of tissue called the synovium. The synovium makes fluid that keeps joints lubricated. When you have rheumatoid arthritis, your immune system sends antibodies to the synovium and causes inflammation. This causes pain and joint damage, especially in small joints in the fingers and wrists. But it can affect any joint.
The good news is that treatment for rheumatoid arthritis has improved dramatically over the last years. Medications, such as methotrexate, help bring the immune system back into balance and steroids can help calm flare-ups. So what was once an often crippling disease can now be controlled for many people — people like Virginia whose disease is pretty severe.
Ms. Wimmer:You can get to the point where you are doing the things that you love and that is the goal.
Ms. Williams:Dr. Manek says if you have pain, swelling and stiffness in your joints that comes and goes and is on both sides of your body, see your doctor to see if it is rheumatoid arthritis.
Rheumatoid is different than osteoarthritis which damages joints because of wear and tear.

Causes
Experts don't know the cause of rheumatoid arthritis. But it's a condition in which the immune system attacks healthy joint tissue by mistake, called autoimmune.
The cause is likely a mix of genetic changes and factors from outside the body, called environmental. Hormones may play a role. An infection with certain viruses may start rheumatoid arthritis in people whose genes make them more likely to get it.
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis include:
- Your sex.People assigned female at birth are more likely than those assigned male at birth to get rheumatoid arthritis.
- Age.Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age. But most often it begins in middle age. Children and young teens may get a related condition called juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
- Family history.Having a family member with rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune conditions may raise the risk of the condition.
- Smoking.Cigarette smoking over time raises the risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis. Smoking also seems to make the condition worse in people who keep smoking.
- Gum infection.A serious gum infection, called periodontal disease, can damage the soft tissue around teeth and raise the risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis.
- Excess weight.People who are overweight seem to be at a somewhat higher risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis.
Complications
Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of getting:
- Osteoporosis.Rheumatoid arthritis itself, and some medicines used to treat it, can increase the risk of this condition. Osteoporosis weakens bones and makes them more likely to break.
- Rheumatoid nodules.These firm bumps of tissue most often form around pressure points, such as the elbows. But these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.
- Dry eyes and mouth.People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to get a condition that lowers the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth. This is called secondary Sjogren's syndrome.
- Infections.Rheumatoid arthritis and many of the medicines used to treat it can harm the immune system. This can lead to more infections. Vaccinations can help prevent infections such as the flu, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.
- Carpal tunnel syndrome.If rheumatoid arthritis affects the wrists, the swelling can press on the nerve to the hand and fingers.
- Heart problems.Rheumatoid arthritis can raise the risk of hardened and blocked arteries. It also can raise the risk of swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the sac around the heart.
- Lung disease.People with rheumatoid arthritis have a higher risk of swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of lung tissues. This can cause scarring and lead to shortness of breath that gets worse over time.
- Lymphoma.Rheumatoid arthritis raises the risk of a group of blood cancers that happen in the lymph system. This is called lymphoma. People with rheumatoid arthritis may have a higher risk of other cancers, as well.
