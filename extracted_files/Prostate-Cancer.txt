Overview
Learn more about prostate cancer from Mayo Clinic urologist Mitchell Humphreys, M.D.
Hi. I'm Dr. Humphreys, a urologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of prostate cancer: What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers about your own health or that of someone you love, we're here to provide you with the best information available. Prostate cancer, unfortunately, is common. It affects one in seven men, making it the second most common cancer among men worldwide. The good news is, is that prostate cancer can be curable, especially when identified and treated early. That is why I and most urologists and medical professionals you talk to encourage men over a certain age to get regular prostate screenings. First, let's talk about what the prostate is and how it functions. The prostate is a small gland that is involved in reproduction and makes some of the essential components in semen. While it is small, it has an important role in reproductive health and can cause voiding or urinary symptoms as men age, as well becoming a source of cancer. Like other kinds of cancer, prostate cancer starts when cells mutate. These small changes in DNA cause the cells to grow faster and live longer than they normally would. As these abnormal cells accumulate, they monopolize resources from normal cells, which can damage surrounding tissue. These cancerous cells can then spread to other parts of the body.
By definition, prostate cancer only affects bodies with male reproductive organs. But in addition, there are some other risk factors that we can monitor. Age is a big one, as prostate cancer is more prevalent in older men, which is why testing is encouraged as men age. For reasons that are unclear, Black men also have a greater risk compared to other races or ethnicities. Being at a higher weight as another possible risk factor. Genetics can also play a role in prostate cancer. A family history of prostate cancer or certain kinds of breast cancer increases the likelihood of being diagnosed with prostate cancer. Well, it's not a guarantee, there are plenty of steps you can take to reduce your risk. A healthy diet and exercise helps your body's overall well-being and can lower your chances of getting prostate cancer.
A big reason to get regular testing is that prostate cancer usually has no presenting symptoms. And when they do show up, it generally indicates a worse stage of cancer. When symptoms do occur, they can include: trouble urinating or decreased force of stream, blood in the urine or semen, bone pain, unexpected weight loss, and unexplained fevers. If you consistently notice any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor right away. How is it diagnosed? There are a variety of ways to detect prostate cancer in both physical exam and from the blood. For starters, there's the DRE, the digital rectal exam. Just like the name suggests, the doctor inserts their finger and your rectum to feel the prostate to detect any abnormalities. You can also get a blood test to look for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA. It is recommended that you have this as well as the physical exam. And if there are any abnormalities, there are additional tests that can be used. If prostate cancer is detected, the next step is figuring out how fast it grows. Fortunately, prostate cancer often doesn't grow very fast. Prostate cancer is graded by a Gleason score, which measures how abnormal or different from normal cells are. There are also other tests to see if the cancer has spread: bone scan, CT scan, MRI, and even specific PET scans. Your doctor will be able to determine which, if any, is appropriate for you.
Treatments are most effective when the cancer is caught early. In fact, immediate treatment isn't always necessary. Keeping an eye on the cancer until it grows bigger is sometimes enough. When cancer is localized only to the prostate, surgery to remove the prostate, or a radical prostatectomy, could be your best option. Radiation is another possibility. With external beam radiation, high-energy beams that deliver photons, target and kill the abnormal cells of the prostate from outside your body. Another treatment is chemotherapy, which uses powerful chemicals, destroy the cancer cells. Cryotherapy, which freezes the cancer cells, or heat, can be used to kill the cancer cells with high-intensity focused ultrasound. Consider that prostate cancer uses male hormone or testosterone as an important factor for growth. In some prostate cancers, it may be beneficial to block that hormone with androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT, which can slow the cancer or even put it in remission. It is generally not curative and usually the cancer will find a way to grow even with the lack of testosterone. Sometimes ADT is used in combination to enhance the treatment success of other therapies, such as with radiation. All of these treatments have side effects of various degrees and have different success rates of treating prostate cancer. It's important that you have a candid discussion with your family and your care team and weigh all that information to make the best choice for you. Support groups for cancer survivors can be helpful in dealing with the stress of the diagnosis and treatments.
As we've seen here, research and scientific advancement has provided us with a host of options for this extremely treatable form of cancer. And with early detection, your chances are even better. While it may not be a thing people want to think about, it's an important part of your health and an expert medical care team can guide you to the solutions that are most tailored for you, your wishes and your body.

Prostate cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. The prostate is part of the male reproductive system.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Prostate cancer is usually found early, and it often grows slowly. Most people with prostate cancer are cured.
People diagnosed with early prostate cancer often have many treatment options to consider. It can feel overwhelming to learn about all the options and make a choice. Treatments may include surgery, radiation therapy or carefully watching the prostate cancer to see if it grows.
If the cancer grows beyond the prostate or if it spreads, there are still many treatment options. Prostate cancer that spreads can be more difficult to cure. But even when a cure isn't possible, treatments can slow the growth of the cancer and help you live longer.

Symptoms
Prostate cancer may not cause symptoms at first. Most prostate cancers are found at an early stage. This means that the cancer is only in the prostate. An early-stage prostate cancer often doesn't cause symptoms.
When they happen, early-stage prostate cancer signs and symptoms can include:
- Blood in the urine, which might make the urine look pink, red or cola-colored.
- Blood in the semen.
- Needing to urinate more often.
- Trouble getting started when trying to urinate.
- Waking up to urinate more often at night.
If the prostate cancer spreads, other symptoms can happen. Prostate cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic prostate cancer. It also might be called stage 4 prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer.
Signs and symptoms of advanced prostate cancer can include:
- Accidental leaking of urine.
- Back pain.
- Bone pain.
- Difficulty getting an erection, called erectile dysfunction.
- Feeling very tired.
- Losing weight without trying.
- Weakness in the arms or legs.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.

Causes
It's often not clear what causes prostate cancer. Healthcare professionals have found some things that raise the risk of this cancer. These include older age, obesity and a family history of prostate cancer. The exact cause of prostate cancer often isn't known.
Prostate cancer starts when cells in the prostate develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA tells the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. The DNA also tells the cells to die at a set time.
In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.
Risk factors
Factors that can increase the risk of prostate cancer include:
- Older age.The risk of prostate cancer goes up with age. It's most common after age 50.
- Race and ethnicity.In the United States, Black people have a greater risk of prostate cancer than do people of other races and ethnicities. Healthcare professionals aren't exactly sure why. In Black people, prostate cancer also is more likely to grow quickly or be advanced when detected.
- Family history of prostate cancer.If a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, your risk may be increased. The risk also may be increased if other close relatives have had prostate cancer. This includes your grandparents and your parents' siblings.
- Family history of DNA changes.Some DNA changes that increase the risk of cancer are passed from parents to children. The DNA changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 can cause a higher risk of prostate cancer. These DNA changes are best known for increasing the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
- Obesity.People who have obesity may have a higher risk of prostate cancer compared with people considered to have a healthy weight. Studies of this issue have had mixed results. In people with obesity, prostate cancer is more likely to grow quickly and more likely to come back after treatment.
- Smoking tobacco.Some research shows a link between smoking and prostate cancer. But not all studies agree. People with prostate cancer who smoke may have a higher risk of the cancer coming back. People who smoke also have a higher risk of the cancer spreading beyond the prostate.
Complications
Complications of prostate cancer and its treatments include:
- Cancer that spreads.Prostate cancer can spread to other parts of the body, such as the bones or other organs. When prostate cancer spreads, it's called metastatic prostate cancer.
- Incontinence.Prostate cancer and its treatment can cause leaking of urine, also called urinary incontinence.
- Erectile dysfunction.Difficulty getting an erection is called erectile dysfunction. It can be caused by prostate cancer or its treatment.
Prevention
There is no sure way to prevent prostate cancer. You can help reduce your risk of prostate cancer if you:
- Choose a healthy diet.Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Limit the amount of animal fats you eat. Fruits and vegetables contain many vitamins and nutrients that can do good for your health.Foods that have been linked to a lower risk of prostate cancer include tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower and soy. No studies have proved that these foods can prevent cancer. If you already enjoy eating these foods, there may be some added benefit in including them in your diet.
- Exercise most days of the week.It's not clear whether exercise can prevent prostate cancer. It may help you maintain a healthy weight. Exercise also may improve your overall health and your mood. Try to exercise most days of the week. If you're new to exercise, talk about it with a healthcare professional. Start slow and work your way up to more exercise time each day.
- Maintain a healthy weight.If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain it. Choose a healthy diet and exercise most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, add more exercise and eat fewer calories. Ask your healthcare professional for help creating a plan for healthy weight loss.
- Don't smoke.If you don't smoke, don't start. If you smoke, talk with a healthcare professional about what might help you quit. Medicines, nicotine replacement products and counseling can help.
- Medicines to lower the risk of prostate cancer.If you have a high risk of prostate cancer, you and your healthcare professional may consider medicines to lower the risk. These medicines include finasteride (Propecia, Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart). They are most often used to treat prostate gland enlargement.Ask your healthcare professional to talk about the benefits and risks of these medicines with you. When prostate cancer happens in people taking these medicines, it tends to grow faster. Your healthcare professional can help explain your risk and whether these medicines are right for you.
