Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an illness that can lead to bruising and bleeding. Low levels of the cells that help blood clot, also known as platelets, most often cause the bleeding.
Once known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,can cause purple bruises. It also can cause tiny reddish-purple dots on the skin that look like a rash.
Children can getafter a virus. They most often get better without treatment. In adults, the illness often lasts months or years.
People withwho aren't bleeding and whose platelet count isn't too low might not need treatment. For worse symptoms, treatment might include medicines to raise platelet count or surgery to remove the spleen.
