Overview
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that begins in the white blood cells. This cancer attacks the skin. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma affects one type of germ-fighting white blood cells called B cells. These cells also are called B lymphocytes.
The types of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma include:
- Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma.
- Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
- Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type.
- Intravascular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma symptoms include a lump or group of lumps on the skin. Sometimes this cancer causes hard patches of skin.
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin is called cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is more common than cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.

Symptoms
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma usually appears as a lump or group of lumps on the skin that don't go away. Symptoms may include:
- A single lump or group of lumps on the skin.
- A lump or lumps on the skin that may look pink, purple or red-brown.
- Redness around the skin lumps.
- Skin lumps that grow slowly.
Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas most often grow on the scalp, forehead or back. Some types of this cancer prefer to grow in other places. Primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphomas tend to grow on the arms or trunk.  Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type usually grows on one leg.
Intravascular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma causes symptoms that are different from the other types. The symptoms may include:
- Hard skin patches.
- Skin around the patches that looks red or purple.
- Areas of skin that look like spider veins.
- Patches on the trunk or thighs.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you.
Causes
The cause of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma often isn't known. This cancer causes a growth of cells in the skin. It starts in germ-fighting white blood cells called lymphocytes. Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma affects specific lymphocytes called B lymphocytes.
Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma happens when B lymphocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
In cutaneous B-cell lymphoma, the cancer cells build up in the skin. The cancer cells rarely spread to other areas of the body.
Risk factors
Risk factors for cutaneous B-cell lymphoma include:
- Weakened immune system.If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medicine or illness, there might be a higher risk of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. People with weakened immune systems might include those taking medicine to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. Certain health conditions also can weaken the immune system, including HIV infection.
- Bacteria transmitted by ticks.Some ticks can transmit bacteria called Borrelia. Borrelia bacteria is linked to Lyme disease. There is some research that also links Borrelia bacteria to cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.
There is no way to prevent cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.
