Causes
The exact cause of dermatographia isn't clear. It may be an allergic reaction, though no specific allergen has been found.
Simple things may cause symptoms of dermatographia. For example, rubbing from your clothes or bedsheets may irritate your skin. In some people, the symptoms are preceded by an infection, emotional stress, vibration, cold exposure or taking a medicine.
Risk factors
Dermatographia can occur at any age. It tends to be more common in teens and young adults. If you have other skin conditions, you may be at greater risk. One such condition is atopic dermatitis (eczema).
Prevention
Try these tips to reduce discomfort and prevent the symptoms of dermatographia:
- Treat skin gently.Use a mild soap or nonsoap cleanser and pat skin dry. Wear things made of cloth that doesn't itch. Use warm water when you take a bath or shower.
- Don't scratch your skin.Try not to scratch. This is a good tip for any skin condition.
