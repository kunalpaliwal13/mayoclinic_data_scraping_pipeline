Bronchitis
- Symptoms &causes
- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic).
Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks.
Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Symptoms
If you have acute bronchitis, you may have cold symptoms, such as:
- Cough
- Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood
- Sore throat
- Mild headache and body aches
- Slight fever and chills
- Fatigue
- Chest discomfort
- Shortness of breath and wheezing
While these symptoms usually improve in about a week, you may have a nagging cough that lingers for several weeks.
For chronic bronchitis, signs and symptoms may include:
- Cough
- Production of mucus
- Fatigue
- Chest discomfort
- Shortness of breath
Chronic bronchitis is typically defined as a productive cough that lasts at least three months, with bouts that recur for at least two consecutive years. If you have chronic bronchitis, you're likely to have periods when your cough or other symptoms worsen. It's also possible to have an acute infection on top of chronic bronchitis.
When to see a doctor
Contact your doctor or clinic for advice if your cough:
- Is accompanied by a fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C).
- Produces blood.
- Is associated with serious or worsening shortness of breath or wheezing.
- Includes other serious signs and symptoms, for example, you appear pale and lethargic, have a bluish tinge to your lips and nail beds, or have trouble thinking clearly or concentrating.
- Lasts more than three weeks.
Before you go in, your doctor or clinic can give you guidance on how to prepare for your appointment.

Causes
Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, typically the same viruses that cause colds and flu (influenza). Many different viruses — all of which are very contagious — can cause acute bronchitis. Antibiotics don't kill viruses, so this type of medication isn't useful in most cases of bronchitis.
Viruses spread mainly from person to person by droplets produced when an ill person coughs, sneezes or talks and you inhale the droplets. Viruses may also spread through contact with an infected object. This happens when you touch something with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, eyes or nose.
The most common cause of chronic bronchitis is cigarette smoking. Air pollution and dust or toxic gases in the environment or workplace also can contribute to the condition.

Risk factors
Factors that increase your risk of bronchitis include:
- Cigarette smoke.People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.
- Low resistance.This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.
- Exposure to irritants on the job.Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.
- Gastric reflux.Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.
Complications
Although a single episode of bronchitis usually isn't cause for concern, it can lead to pneumonia in some people. Repeated bouts of bronchitis, however, may mean that you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Prevention
To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips:
- Get an annual flu shot.Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. Also ask your doctor or clinic if you need a vaccination that protects against certain types of pneumonia.
- Wash your hands.To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
- Avoid close contact with people who have a viral infection.Stay away from people who have the flu or another respiratory illness.
- Avoid cigarette smoke.Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis.
- Wear appropriate face covering.If you have, consider wearing a face mask at work if you're exposed to dust or fumes. Talk to your employer about the appropriate protection. Wearing a face mask when you're going to be among crowds helps reduce exposure to infections.
