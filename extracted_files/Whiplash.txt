Overview
Whiplash is a neck injury due to forceful, rapid back-and-forth movement of the neck, like the cracking of a whip.
Whiplash is commonly caused by rear-end car crashes. But whiplash also can result from sports accidents, physical abuse and other types of traumas, such as a fall. Whiplash may be called a neck sprain or strain, but these terms also include other types of neck injuries.
Most people with whiplash get better within a few weeks by following a treatment plan that includes pain medicine and exercise. However, some people have long-lasting neck pain and other complications.

Causes
Whiplash most often occurs when the head is quickly thrown backward and then forward with force. This often happens as a result of a rear-end car crash. This motion can cause damage to the muscles and tissues of the neck.
Risk factors
Risk factors for whiplash include:
- Rear-end car crash.This is the most common risk factor for getting whiplash.
- Physical abuse or assault.Whiplash can occur if you are punched or shaken. It's one of the injuries seen in shaken baby syndrome.
- Contact sports.Football tackles and other sports-related contact hits sometimes can cause whiplash.
Complications
Most people who have whiplash feel better within a few weeks. They don't seem to have lasting effects from the injury. But some people have pain for months or years after the injury.
It's hard to predict how recovery from whiplash might go. As a rule, you may be more likely to have ongoing pain if your first symptoms were intense, started quickly and included:
- Severe neck pain.
- More-limited range of motion.
- Pain that spread to the arms.
The following risk factors have been linked to a worse outcome:
- Having had whiplash before.
- Older age.
- Already having low back or neck pain.
- A high-speed injury.
