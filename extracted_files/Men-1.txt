Overview
Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare condition. It mainly causes tumors in the glands that make and release hormones. These are called the endocrine glands. The condition also can cause tumors in the small intestine and stomach. Another name for MEN 1 is Wermer's syndrome.
The endocrine gland tumors that form due to MEN 1 usually are not cancer. Most often, the tumors grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Some glands affected by MEN 1 also may release too many hormones. That can lead to other health concerns.
The extra hormones of MEN 1 can cause many symptoms. These symptoms may include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines.
MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect health concerns, and healthcare professionals can provide treatment as needed.
MEN 1 is an inherited condition. That means people who have a genetic change that causes MEN 1 can pass it on to their children.

Symptoms
Symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can include the following:
- Tiredness.
- Bone pain or broken bones.
- Kidney stones.
- Ulcers in the stomach or intestines.
- Stomach pain.
- Muscle weakness.
- Depression.
- Acid reflux.
- Frequent diarrhea.
Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body.
Causes
Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is caused by a change in the MEN1 gene. That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin. Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly.
Many different changes in the MEN1 gene can cause the MEN 1 condition to develop. People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children. Many people with a change in the MEN1 gene inherit it from a parent. But some people are the first in their family to have a new MEN1 gene change that doesn't come from a parent.
Risk factors
Risk factors for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) include the following:
- Children with a parent who has a genetic change in the MEN1 gene are at risk of the MEN 1 condition. That's because these children have a 50% chance of having the same genetic change that causes MEN 1.
- Parents and siblings of people who have a change in the MEN1 gene also are at risk. That's because they may have the same genetic change, even if they haven't had any symptoms of MEN 1.
