Parotid tumors are growths of cells that start in the parotid glands. The parotid glands are two salivary glands that sit just in front of the ears. There is one on each side of the face. Salivary glands make saliva to help with chewing and digesting food.
There are many salivary glands in the lips, cheeks, mouth and throat. Growths of cells, which are called tumors, can happen in any of these glands. The parotid glands are the most common place that salivary gland tumors happen.
Most parotid tumors aren't cancerous. These are called noncancerous or benign parotid tumors. Sometimes the tumors are cancers. These are called malignant parotid tumors or parotid gland cancers.
Parotid tumors often cause swelling in the face or jaw. Other symptoms include problems swallowing or a loss of facial movement.
Diagnosis and treatment for parotid tumors is often done by doctors who specialize in problems that affect the ear, nose and throat. These doctors are called ENT specialists or otolaryngologists.

Causes
It's not clear what causes parotid tumors. These tumors start as a growth of cells in the parotid glands. The parotid glands are two salivary glands that sit just in front of the ears. There is one on each side of the face. Salivary glands make saliva to help with chewing and digesting food.
Parotid tumors happen when cells in the parotid glands develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
Sometimes the changes in the DNA turn the cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.
Risk factors
Factors that increase the risk of parotid tumors include:
- Increasing age.Parotid tumors can happen at any age. However, they are more common in older adults.
- Previous radiation therapy treatments.People who have had radiation therapy to the head and neck area in the past are at a higher risk of parotid tumors.
- Exposure to harmful substances.People who work with certain substances may have an increased risk of salivary gland tumors, including parotid tumors. Examples of industries associated with an increased risk include those that involve rubber manufacturing and nickel.
