Overview
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the medical name for a group of genetic conditions that affect the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are a pair of walnut-sized organs above the kidneys. They make important hormones, including:
- Cortisol. This controls the body's response to illness or stress.
- Mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These control sodium and potassium levels.
- Androgens such as testosterone. These sex hormones are needed for growth and development in both males and females.
In people with, a gene change results in a lack of one of the enzyme proteins needed to make these hormones.
The two major types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia are:
- Classic.This type is rarer and more serious. It's usually found by tests at birth or in early infancy.
- Nonclassic.This type is milder and more common. It may not be found until childhood or early adulthood.
There is no cure for congenital adrenal hyperplasia. But with proper treatment, most people who havecan lead full lives.

Symptoms
Symptoms ofvary. The symptoms depend on which gene is affected. They also depend on how greatly the adrenal glands lack one of the enzymes needed to make hormones. With, the hormones that the body needs to work properly are thrown out of balance. That may lead to too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, too many androgens or a mix of these issues.
Classic CAH
Symptoms of classiccan include:
- Not enough cortisol.With classic, the body doesn't make enough of the hormone cortisol. This can cause problems keeping blood pressure, blood sugar and energy at healthy levels. It also can cause problems during physical stress such as illness.
- Adrenal crisis.People with classiccan be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis. It can be life-threatening.
- External genitals that don't look typical.In female infants, some parts of the genitals on the outside of the body may look different than usual. For instance, the clitoris may be enlarged and resemble a penis. The labia may be partly closed and look like a scrotum. The tube through which urine leaves the body and the vagina may be one opening instead of two separate openings. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries often develop in a typical manner.Male infants withoften have genitals that look typical but sometimes are enlarged.
- Too much androgen.An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can lead to short height and early puberty for children. Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. Serious acne also may occur.Extra androgen hormones in females may lead to facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice.
- Altered growth.Children may grow fast. And their bones could be more developed than is typical for their age. Final height may be shorter than average.
- Fertility issues.These can include irregular menstrual periods or not having periods at all. Some women with classicmay have trouble becoming pregnant. Fertility issues sometimes can occur in men.

Nonclassic CAH
Often, there are no symptoms of nonclassicwhen a baby is born. Some people with nonclassicnever have symptoms. The condition is not found on routine infant blood screening tests. If symptoms occur, they usually appear in late childhood or early adulthood.
Females who have nonclassicmay have genitals that look typical at birth. Later in life, they may have:
- Irregular menstrual periods, or none at all.
- Trouble getting pregnant.
- Features such as facial hair, more body hair than usual and a deeper voice.
Sometimes, nonclassicmay be confused with a hormonal condition that happens during the reproductive years called polycystic ovary syndrome.
Nonclassicsymptoms in children of either birth sex also can include:
- Symptoms of early puberty, such as growth of pubic hair sooner than usual.
- Serious acne.
- Rapid growth during childhood with bones that are more developed than is typical.
- Shorter than expected final height.
When to see a doctor
Most often, classicis found at birth through routine newborn screening tests. Or it's found when a baby's outer genitals do not look typical.also may be detected when infants show symptoms of serious illness due to low levels of cortisol, aldosterone or both.
In children who have nonclassic, symptoms of early puberty may appear. If you have concerns about your child's growth or development, schedule a checkup with your child's healthcare professional.
In older people who have irregular periods, trouble getting pregnant or both, screening formay be appropriate.
If you are planning pregnancy or are pregnant and may be at risk of, ask your healthcare professional about genetic counseling. A genetic counselor can tell you if your genes might affect you or any children you decide to have.
Causes
The most common cause ofis the lack of the enzyme protein known as 21-hydroxylase. Sometimes,is called 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The body needs this enzyme to make proper amounts of hormones. Very rarely, a lack of other much rarer enzymes also can cause.
is a genetic condition. That means it's passed from parents to children. It's present at birth. Children with the condition have two parents who both carry the genetic change that causes. Or they have two parents who havethemselves. This is known as the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.
People can carry thegene and not have symptoms of the condition. This is called being a silent carrier. If a silent carrier becomes pregnant, that person can pass the gene to a child. If tests show that you're a silent carrier of thegene and you have a partner of the opposite sex, talk with your healthcare professional. It's likely that your partner will need to get tested for thegene before pregnancy so that you can better understand the risks.
Risk factors
Factors that raise the risk of havinginclude:
- Parents who both have.
- Parents who are both carriers of the changed gene that causes.
- Being of Ashkenazi Jewish, Latino, Mediterranean, Yugoslav or Yup'ik descent.
Complications
People who have classicare at risk of a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis. This emergency needs to be treated right away. Adrenal crisis can happen within the first few days after birth. It also can be triggered at any age by an infectious illness or physical stress such as surgery.
With adrenal crisis, very low levels of cortisol in the blood can cause:
- Diarrhea.
- Vomiting.
- Dehydration.
- Confusion.
- Low blood sugar levels.
- Seizures.
- Shock.
- Coma.
Aldosterone also may be low. This leads to dehydration, low sodium and high potassium levels. The nonclassic form ofdoesn't cause adrenal crisis.
People who have either classic or nonclassicmay have irregular menstrual cycles and fertility issues.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent. If you're thinking of starting a family and you're at risk of having a child with, talk with your healthcare professional. You may be told to see a genetic counselor.
