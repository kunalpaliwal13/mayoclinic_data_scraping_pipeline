Symptoms
Symptoms ofvary but are usually present for a long time. The most common include:
- Belly pain, cramping or bloating that is related to passing stool.
- Changes in appearance of stool.
- Changes in how often you are passing stool.
Other symptoms that are often related include sensation of incomplete evacuation and increased gas or mucus in the stool.
IBS is a functional disorder. Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.

Causes
The exact cause ofisn't known. Factors that appear to play a role include:
- Muscle contractions in the intestine.The walls of the intestines are lined with layers of muscle that contract as they move food through the digestive tract. Contractions that are stronger and last longer than usual can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. Weak contractions can slow food passage and lead to hard, dry stools.
- Nervous system.Issues with the nerves in the digestive system may cause discomfort when the belly area, called the abdomen, stretches from gas or stool. Poorly coordinated signals between the brain and the intestines can cause the body to overreact to changes that typically occur in the digestive process. This can result in pain, diarrhea or constipation.
- Severe infection.can develop after a severe bout of diarrhea caused by bacteria or a virus. This is called gastroenteritis.also might be associated with a surplus of bacteria in the intestines, known as bacterial overgrowth.
- Early-life stress.People exposed to stressful events, especially in childhood, tend to have more symptoms of.
- Changes in gut microbes.Examples include changes in bacteria, fungi and viruses, which typically live in the intestines and play a key role in health. Research indicates that the microbes in people withmight differ from those in people who don't have.
Triggers
Symptoms ofcan be triggered by:
- Food.The role of food allergy or intolerance inisn't fully understood. A true food allergy rarely causes. But many people have worsesymptoms when they eat or drink certain foods or beverages. These include wheat, dairy products, citrus fruits, beans, cabbage, milk and carbonated drinks.
