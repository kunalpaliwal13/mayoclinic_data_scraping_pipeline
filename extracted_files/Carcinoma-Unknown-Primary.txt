Overview
Carcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis healthcare professionals give when they can't find where a cancer started. A carcinoma of unknown primary is an advanced cancer that has spread in the body.
Most often, health professionals detect a cancer when it grows in the place where it started. The place where a cancer started growing is called the primary cancer. Sometimes health professionals first detect a cancer when it spreads. When cancer spreads it's called metastatic cancer.
In carcinoma of unknown primary, healthcare professionals find the metastatic cancer. But they can't find the primary cancer. Carcinoma of unknown primary also is called occult primary cancer.
Healthcare teams often use the kind of primary cancer you have to help decide on the treatment. If you're found to have carcinoma of unknown primary, this piece of information is missing. Your healthcare team will work to find out what kind of cancer you have.
