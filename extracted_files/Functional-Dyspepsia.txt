Overview
Functional dyspepsia is a term used to describe a lingering upset stomach that has no obvious cause. Functional dyspepsia (dis-PEP-see-uh) also is called nonulcer dyspepsia.
Functional dyspepsia is common. It is a constant condition, but symptoms don't happen all the time. Symptoms are like those of an ulcer. They include pain or discomfort in the upper belly, bloating, belching and nausea.

Symptoms
Symptoms of functional dyspepsia may include:
- Pain or burning in the stomach, bloating, excessive belching or nausea after eating.
- An early feeling of fullness when eating. The feeling of fullness also is called satiety.
- Stomach pain that happens unrelated to meals or goes away when eating.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you experience constant symptoms that worry you.
Seek medical attention right away if you experience:
- Bloody vomit.
- Dark, tarry stools.
- Shortness of breath.
- Pain in your jaw, neck or arm.
- Unexplained weight loss.
Causes
No one knows what causes functional dyspepsia. Medical professionals consider it a functional disorder. That means it can't be explained by a medical condition, so routine testing may not show any problems or causes. As a result, the diagnosis is based on symptoms.
Risk factors
Some factors can increase the risk of functional dyspepsia. They include:
- Being female.
- Using certain pain relievers that are available without a prescription. These include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), which can cause stomach problems.
- Smoking.
- Anxiety or depression.
- History of childhood physical or sexual abuse.
- Helicobacter pylori infection.
