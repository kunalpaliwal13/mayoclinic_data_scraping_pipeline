Overview
Kyphosis is an excessive forward rounding of the upper back.
In older people, kyphosis is often due to weakness in the spinal bones that causes them to compress or crack. Other types of kyphosis can appear in infants or teens. These types are due to malformation of the spine or wedging of the spinal bones over time.
Mild kyphosis causes few problems. Serious kyphosis can cause pain and be disfiguring. Treatment for kyphosis depends on your age, and the cause and seriousness of the curvature.

Symptoms
Mild kyphosis may not have any noticeable symptoms. In fact, the upper back naturally has a little kyphosis. People who have excessive curvature may experience back pain and stiffness.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you notice an increased curve in your upper back or in your child's spine.
Causes
The bones that make up a healthy spine look like cylinders stacked in a column. These bones are called vertebrae. Kyphosis happens when the vertebrae in the back become more wedge shaped.
The shape of vertebrae can be changed by:
- Fractures.Broken vertebrae can result in curvature of the spine. Compression fractures, which can happen in weakened bone, are the most common. Mild compression fractures may not produce noticeable symptoms.
- Osteoporosis.Weak bones can cause spinal curvature, especially if weakened vertebrae develop compression fractures. Osteoporosis is most common in older women and people who have taken corticosteroids for long periods of time.
- Disk degeneration.Soft, circular disks act as cushions between spinal vertebrae. With age, these disks flatten and shrink, which often worsens kyphosis.
- Scheuermann's disease.Also called Scheuermann's kyphosis, this disease usually becomes noticeable during adolescence.
- Other problems.Spinal bones that don't develop properly before birth can cause kyphosis. Kyphosis in children also can be associated with certain medical conditions.
Risk factors
The risk of developing kyphosis as an adult increases with age as bone density decreases and spinal disks degenerate. In children, certain genetic and metabolic conditions may put them at increased risk for kyphosis, including osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.
Complications
In addition to causing back pain, kyphosis may cause:
- Limited physical functions.Kyphosis is associated with weakened back muscles and difficulty doing tasks such as walking and getting out of chairs. The spinal curvature can also make it difficult to gaze upward or drive and can cause pain when you lie down.
- Digestive problems.Serious kyphosis can compress the digestive tract, causing problems such as acid reflux and difficulty with swallowing.
- Back pain.Some patients with serious kyphosis experience back pain.
- Body image problems.People with kyphosis, especially adolescents, may have poor body image from having a rounded back.
