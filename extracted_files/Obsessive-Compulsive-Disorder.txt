Obsession symptoms
obsessions are lasting and unwanted thoughts that keeping coming back or urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by acting based on ritual. These obsessions usually intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things.
Obsessions often have themes, such as:
- Fear of contamination or dirt.

Compulsion symptoms
compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to do. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. But taking part in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only limited relief from anxiety.
You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are beyond reason and often don't relate to the issue they're intended to fix.
As with obsessions, compulsions usually have themes, such as:
- Washing and cleaning.
- Checking.
- Counting.
- Ordering.
- Following a strict routine.
- Demanding reassurance.
Examples of compulsion symptoms include:
- Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw.
- Checking doors over and over again to make sure they're locked.
- Checking the stove over and over again to make sure it's off.
- Counting in certain patterns.
- Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase.
- Trying to replace a bad thought with a good thought.
