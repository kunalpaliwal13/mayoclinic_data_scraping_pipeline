Overview
A vaginal yeast infection is a fungal infection. It causes irritation, discharge and itching of the vagina and the vulva. Vaginal yeast infection also is called vaginal candidiasis.
Vaginal yeast infection affects most people assigned female at birth at some point in life. Many have at least two infections.
People who don't have sex can get a vaginal yeast infection. So it isn't though of as a sexually transmitted infection. But you can get vaginal yeast infections through sex.
There's a higher risk of vaginal yeast infection when you start having sex. And some vaginal yeast infections may be linked to sexual contact between the mouth and genital area, called oral-genital sex.
Medicines can treat vaginal yeast infections. Yeast infections that happen four times or more a year may need a longer treatment course and a plan to prevent them.

Causes
The fungus Candida albicans causes most vaginal yeast infections.
Most often, the vagina has a balance of yeast, including candida, and bacteria. Certain bacteria called lactobacillus work to prevent too much yeast.
But some factors can affect the balance. Too much candida or the fungus growing deeper into vaginal cells causes symptoms of a yeast infection.
Too much yeast can result from:
- Antibiotic use.
- Pregnancy.
- Diabetes that isn't well-managed.
- A weakened immune system.
- Use of birth control pills or hormone therapy that raises levels of the hormone estrogen.
Candida albicans is the most common type of fungus to cause yeast infections. When other types of candida fungus cause yeast infections, they can be harder to treat.
Risk factors
Factors that raise the risk of getting a yeast infection include:
- Antibiotic use.Yeast infections are common in people who take antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill a range of bacteria. They also kill healthy bacteria in the vagina. This can lead to too much yeast.
- Raised estrogen levels.Yeast infections are more common in people with higher estrogen levels. Pregnancy, birth control pills and hormone therapy can raise estrogen levels.
- Diabetes that isn't well-managed.People with poorly managed blood sugar are at greater risk of yeast infections than are people with well-managed blood sugar.
- Weakened immune system.People with lowered immunity are more likely to get yeast infections. Lower immunity might be from corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection or other diseases that suppress the immune system.
Prevention
To lower your risk of vaginal yeast infections, wear underwear that has a cotton crotch and doesn't fit too tightly.
Also, these tips might help prevent a yeast infection:
- Do not wear tight pantyhose, underwear or jeans.
- Do not douche. This removes some of the good germs in the vagina that protect from infection.
- Do not use scented products in the vaginal area. For instance, don't use scented bubble bath, soap, menstrual pads and tampons.
- Do not use hot tubs or take hot baths.
- Do not use antibiotics you don't need. For instance, don't take antibiotics for colds or other viral infections.
- Do not stay in wet clothes, such as swimsuits and workout clothes, for longer than needed.
