Overview
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's caused by an extremely stressful or terrifying event — either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the event.
Most people who go through traumatic events may have a hard time adjusting and coping for a short time. But with time and by taking good care of themselves, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or years, and affect their ability to function daily, they may have.
Getting treatment aftersymptoms arise can be very important to ease symptoms and help people function better.

Symptoms
Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks.
Generally,symptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person.
Intrusive memories
Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:
- Unwanted, distressing memories of a traumatic event that come back over and over again.
- Reliving a traumatic event as if it were happening again, also known as flashbacks.
- Upsetting dreams or nightmares about a traumatic event.
- Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of a traumatic event.
Avoidance
Symptoms of avoidance may include:
- Trying not to think or talk about a traumatic event.
- Staying away from places, activities or people that remind you of a traumatic event.
Negative changes in thinking and mood
Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:
- Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world.
- Ongoing negative emotions of fear, blame, guilt, anger or shame.
- Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of a traumatic event.
- Feeling detached from family and friends.
- Not being interested in activities you once enjoyed.
- Having a hard time feeling positive emotions.
- Feeling emotionally numb.
Changes in physical and emotional reactions
Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions, also called arousal symptoms, may include:
- Being easily startled or frightened.
- Always being on guard for danger.
- Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast.

Intensity of symptoms
Over time,symptoms can vary in how severe they are. You may have moresymptoms when you're generally stressed or when you come across reminders of what you went through, including the same time of year when a past traumatic event happened. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your assault.

Causes
You can develop post-traumatic stress disorder when you go through, see or learn about an event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual assault.
Healthcare professionals aren't sure why some people get. As with most mental health problems, a mix of factors probably causes it, including:
- Extremely stressful experiences, as well as the amount and severity of trauma you've gone through in your life.
- Inherited mental health risks, such as a family history of anxiety and depression.
- Inherited features of your personality — often called your temperament.
- The way your brain regulates the chemicals and hormones your body releases in response to stress.
Risk factors
People of all ages can have post-traumatic stress disorder. But you may be more likely to developafter a traumatic event if you:
- Have severe or long-lasting traumatic experiences.
- Were physically injured during the traumatic event.
- Have been exposed to other trauma earlier in life, such as childhood abuse.
- Have a job that exposes you to traumatic events, such as being in the military or being a first responder.
- Have other mental health problems, such as anxiety or depression.
- Drink too much or misuse drugs.
- Do not have a good support system of family and friends.
- Have blood relatives with mental health problems, includingor depression.
Traumatic events that raise risk
The most common events that can lead toinclude:
- Combat exposure.
- Childhood physical abuse.
- Sexual violence.
- Physical assault.
- Being threatened with a weapon.
- An accident.
Many other traumatic events also can lead to, such as fire, natural disaster, mugging, robbery, plane crash, torture, kidnapping, a life-threatening medical diagnosis, a terrorist attack, and other extreme or life-threatening events.
Complications
Post-traumatic stress disorder can disrupt your whole life — your education, job, how well you get along with others, physical health and enjoyment of everyday activities. Havingalso may raise your risk of other mental health problems, such as:
- Depression and anxiety disorders.
- Issues with drugs or alcohol use.
- Thinking about and attempting suicide.
Prevention
After surviving a traumatic event, many people have-like symptoms at first, such as not being able to stop thinking about what's happened. Fear, anxiety, anger, depression and guilt are all common reactions to trauma. But most people exposed to trauma don't go on to develop.
Getting timely help and support may prevent usual stress reactions from getting worse and leading to. This may mean turning to family and friends who will listen and offer comfort. It also may mean seeking out a mental health professional for a brief course of therapy. Some people also may find it helpful to turn to their faith communities.
Support from others also may prevent you from turning to unhealthy coping methods, such as misusing alcohol or drugs.
