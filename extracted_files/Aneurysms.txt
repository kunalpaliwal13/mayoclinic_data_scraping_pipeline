Overview
An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm can break open. This is called a rupture. A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body. It often leads to death. Some aneurysms cause no symptoms. You might not know you have an aneurysm even if it is large.
Aneurysms can form in several parts of the body, including:
- The body's main artery, called the aorta (aortic aneurysm).
- The part of the aorta that passes through the belly area (abdominal aortic aneurysm).
- The part of the aorta that passes through the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm).
- Blood vessels that send blood to the brain (brain aneurysm).
- Blood vessels in other parts of the body, such as the legs, groin or neck (peripheral aneurysm).
Some small aneurysms have a low risk of rupture. To determine the risk of an aneurysm rupture, a healthcare professional considers:
- Your symptoms.
- Your medical history.
- Your family's medical history.
- The size, shape and location of the aneurysm.
Some people with aneurysms only need regular health checkups and imaging tests. If an aneurysm breaks open, emergency treatment is needed. Treatment may involve open surgery or a less-invasive treatment called endovascular surgery.
Vivien Williams: An aneurysm is an abnormal bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel.
Bernard Bendok, M.D., Neurosurgery, Mayo Clinic: A portion of these patients will go on to have a rupture. And the challenge with rupture is that it's unpredictable.
Vivien Williams: Dr. Bernard Bendok says a ruptured aneurysm is a medical emergency that can cause life-threatening bleeding in the brain.
Dr. Bendok: The typical presentation is somebody who has the worst headache of their life.
Vivien Williams: Fast treatment is essential. It includes open surgery or less-invasive options, such as sealing the ruptured artery from within the blood vessel with metal coils and/or stents.
Dr. Bendok says 1 to 2 percent of the population have aneurysms and only a small percentage of that group will experience a rupture. People who have a family history of aneurysms, have polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disease, and people who smoke are at increased risk of rupture and should consider screening. If a rupture happens, fast treatment can save lives.
