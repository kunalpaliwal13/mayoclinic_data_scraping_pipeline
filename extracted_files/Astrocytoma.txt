Astrocytoma
- Symptoms &causes
- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Astrocytoma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The growth, called a tumor, starts in cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
Astrocytoma symptoms vary based on the tumor's location. An astrocytoma in the brain can cause personality changes, seizures, headaches and nausea. An astrocytoma in the spinal cord can cause weakness and disability in the area affected by the growing tumor.
Some astrocytomas grow slowly. They aren't considered to be cancerous. These noncancerous tumors are sometimes called benign astrocytomas. Most astrocytomas grow quickly and are considered to be brain cancers. These are sometimes called malignant astrocytomas. Whether your tumor is benign or malignant is one factor your healthcare team considers when creating a treatment plan.

Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you.
Causes
The cause of astrocytoma often isn't known. This tumor starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. It forms in cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.
Astrocytoma happens when astrocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The tumor cells form a growth that may press on nearby parts of the brain or spinal cord as it gets bigger. Sometimes the DNA changes turn the tumor cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
Risk factors
Risk factors for astrocytoma include:
- History of radiation therapy.If you had radiation treatments for another cancer type, especially radiation near your head or neck, you may be more at risk.
- Middle age.Astrocytoma can happen at any age. It's most common in adults between ages 30 and 55.
- Hereditary syndromes.People with some disorders that run in families may be more likely to have astrocytoma. Examples include neurofibromatosis type 1, Lynch syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
There is no way to prevent astrocytoma.
