Overview
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a rare heart condition that a child is born with. That means it's a congenital heart defect. In this condition, the left side of the heart doesn't develop fully and is too small. So it can't pump blood well. Instead, the right side of the heart must pump blood to the lungs and to the rest of the body.
Treatment for hypoplastic left heart syndrome may include medicines, heart surgery or a heart transplant. Advances in care have improved the outlook for babies born with HLHS.

Symptoms
Babies born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) usually are very sick soon after birth. Symptoms of HLHS include:
- Blue or gray skin, lips or fingernails. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see.
- Rapid, difficult breathing.
- Poor feeding.
- Cold hands and feet.
- Weak pulse.
- Being more drowsy or less active than is typical for most babies.
Without treatment, a baby with this condition may go into shock. Symptoms of shock include:
- Cool, clammy skin that can be pale or lips that can be blue or gray.
- A weak and rapid pulse.
- Breathing that may be slow and shallow or very rapid.
- Dull eyes that seem to stare.
When to see a doctor
Get emergency medical help if your baby has:
- Changes in skin or nail color.
- Trouble breathing or fast breathing.
- Weak pulse or rapid pulse.
- Cool clammy skin.
Causes
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) happens in the womb when a baby's heart develops. The cause isn't known. Gene changes may play a role.
In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart hasn't grown enough so it does not develop fully. It can't properly send blood to the body. In HLHS, the following areas of the heart are too small:
- The lower left heart chamber, called the left ventricle.
- The body's main artery, called the aorta.
- The heart valves on the left side of the heart, called the aortic and mitral valves.
After birth, the right side of a baby's heart usually pumps blood both to the lungs and to the rest of the body. The blood passes through an opening called the ductus arteriosus. This opening, also called a vessel, connects the pulmonary artery directly to the aorta. The oxygen-rich blood goes back to the right side of the heart through a natural opening between the upper chambers of the heart. The opening is called the foramen ovale.
The ductus arteriosus usually closes after the first day or two of life. When that happens, the right side of the heart has no way to pump blood to the body. The left side of the heart takes over this job.
But in babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side can't pump blood well. So they need medicine to keep these connections open and keep blood flowing to the body until they have heart surgery.

HLHS. HLHS. Hypo. Plastic. Left heart. Syndrome.
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Whoa, that's a lot of words!
What is HLHS?
HLHS is when you're missing the bottom left of your heart.
The left side of the heart, it doesn't pump blood as well as the right side. Kids who have HLHS, they all have like a big scar, because they had to have open heart surgery.
I got the surgery when I was a baby.
Three open heart surgeries – two when she was just born, and one when she was two.
I just found out I was going to have a sister, and she was just born, but then she had to be rushed to get surgery, so it was kind of hard.
My brother Henry had three surgeries.
I have a scar on my heart.
He has scars on his heart.
I have stitches on my heart. I needed help.
Children with HLHS may require a heart transplant later in life.
The power of teamwork
What makes a strong team is that people will help you feel better.
I have a team. I have doctors. I have nurses.
And they try and help me feel better.
Everybody's working together to help Sophie stay healthy and feel like a normal girl. There's a lot of teams helping a child with HLHS.
What we all really want, I guess, is just a cure for HLHS.
What is hope?
Hope is when you want something to happen.
Hope is when you have confidence in something.
HLHS research is like a lightsaber is to a Jedi Knight. The more research that we put into HLHS, the more lives will be saved, and the more ... closer we can get to developing a cure.
I hope they all — all the kids with HLHS — be really strong and live a long life.
I hope that the doctors find the cure for HLHS. We're all part of the team.

Risk factors
People who have a child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) have a higher risk of having another baby with this or a similar condition.
There are no other clear risk factors for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
Complications
With proper treatment, many babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) survive. But they do need many surgeries and can have less energy and other challenges. Complications of HLHS may include:
- Getting tired more easily during sports or other exercises.
- Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
- Fluid buildup, called edema, in the lungs, stomach area, legs and feet.
- Not growing well.
- Developmental conditions related to the brain and nervous system.
- Need for more heart surgery or a heart transplant.
Prevention
There's no way to prevent hypoplastic left heart syndrome. If you were born with a heart condition, talk with a heart doctor and genetic counselor before getting pregnant.
