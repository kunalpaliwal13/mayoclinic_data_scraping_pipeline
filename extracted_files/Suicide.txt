Symptoms
Suicide warning signs or suicidal thoughts include:
- Talking about suicide — for example, making statements such as "I'm going to kill myself," "I wish I were dead" or "I wish I hadn't been born"
- Getting the means to take your own life, such as buying a gun or stockpiling pills
- Withdrawing from social contact and wanting to be left alone
- Having mood swings, such as being emotionally high one day and deeply discouraged the next
- Being preoccupied with death, dying or violence
- Feeling trapped or hopeless about a situation
- Increasing use of alcohol or drugs
- Changing normal routine, including eating or sleeping patterns
- Doing risky or self-destructive things, such as using drugs or driving recklessly
- Giving away belongings or getting affairs in order when there's no other logical explanation for doing this
- Saying goodbye to people as if they won't be seen again
- Developing personality changes or being severely anxious or agitated, particularly when experiencing some of the warning signs listed above
Warning signs aren't always obvious, and they may vary from person to person. Some people make their intentions clear, while others keep suicidal thoughts and feelings secret.
When to see a doctor
If you're feeling suicidal, but you aren't immediately thinking of hurting yourself:
- Reach out to a close friend or loved one — even though it may be hard to talk about your feelings
- Contact a minister, spiritual leader or someone in your faith community
- Call a suicide hotline
- Make an appointment with your doctor, other health care provider or a mental health professional
Suicidal thinking doesn't get better on its own — so get help.
Causes
Suicidal thoughts have many causes. Most often, suicidal thoughts are the result of feeling like you can't cope when you're faced with what seems to be an overwhelming life situation. If you don't have hope for the future, you may mistakenly think suicide is a solution. You may experience a sort of tunnel vision, where in the middle of a crisis you believe suicide is the only way out.
There also may be a genetic link to suicide. People who complete suicide or who have suicidal thoughts or behavior are more likely to have a family history of suicide.
Risk factors
Although attempted suicide is more frequent for women, men are more likely than women to complete suicide because they typically use more-lethal methods, such as a firearm.
You may be at risk of suicide if you:
- Attempted suicide before
- Feel hopeless, worthless, agitated, socially isolated or lonely
- Experience a stressful life event, such as the loss of a loved one, military service, a breakup, or financial or legal problems
- Have a substance abuse problem — alcohol and drug abuse can worsen thoughts of suicide and make you feel reckless or impulsive enough to act on your thoughts
- Have suicidal thoughts and have access to firearms in your home
- Have an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder
- Have a family history of mental disorders, substance abuse, suicide, or violence, including physical or sexual abuse
- Have a medical condition that can be linked to depression and suicidal thinking, such as chronic disease, chronic pain or terminal illness
- Are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender with an unsupportive family or in a hostile environment
Children and teenagers
Suicide in children and teenagers can follow stressful life events. What a young person sees as serious and insurmountable may seem minor to an adult — such as problems in school or the loss of a friendship. In some cases, a child or teen may feel suicidal due to certain life circumstances that he or she may not want to talk about, such as:
- Having a psychiatric disorder, including depression
- Loss or conflict with close friends or family members
- History of physical or sexual abuse
- Problems with alcohol or drugs
- Physical or medical issues, for example, becoming pregnant or having a sexually transmitted infection
- Being the victim of bullying
- Being uncertain of sexual orientation
- Reading or hearing an account of suicide or knowing a peer who died by suicide
If you have concerns about a friend or family member, asking about suicidal thoughts and intentions is the best way to identify risk.
Murder and suicide
In rare cases, people who are suicidal are at risk of killing others and then themselves. Known as a homicide-suicide or murder-suicide, some risk factors include:
- History of conflict with a spouse or romantic partner
- Current family legal or financial problems
- History of mental health problems, particularly depression
- Alcohol or drug abuse
- Having access to a firearm
Starting antidepressants and increased suicide risk
Most antidepressants are generally safe, but the Food and Drug Administration requires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings, the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.
However, keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to reduce suicide risk in the long run by improving mood.
Female 1:I have my ups and downs just like anybody else.
Male 1:Maybe more than anybody else.
Female 2:I can be hard to figure out
Male 2:and I like my privacy.
Male 3:I don't want you looking over my shoulder all the time.
Female 3:But you know your kid better than anybody else and if you think he's acting different than usual,
Male 1:acting really down, crying all the time for no good reason
Female 2:or getting really mad,
Female 1:not able to sleep or sleeping too much,
Male 3:shutting their friends out or giving their stuff away,
Female 2:acting reckless, drinking, using drugs, staying out late,
Male 2:suddenly not doing stuff they used to love
Female 3:or doing stuff that's just not like him,
Male 1:it might be nothing to worry about. It might just be high school
Female 1:or it might be something more. He might be depressed.
Female 3:Not just feeling down, really depressed.
Male 2:It might be that your kid is thinking about killing himself.
Male 3:It happens more than you think, more than it should.
Female 3:And people say "I had no idea."
Male 1:"I thought it was just a phase he was going through."
Female 1:"I never thought she'd do it."
Male 2:"I wish he'd come to me."
Female 2:"I wish he had said something."
Male 3:"I wish I'd said something."
Female 3:when it's too late. So if you think your kids acting different, if she seems like a different person, say something.
Male 1:Say "What's wrong? How can I help?"
Female 2:and ask him straight out, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"
Female 1:It doesn't hurt to ask. In fact, it helps.
Male 3:When people are thinking about killing themselves, they want somebody to ask.
Male 2:They want somebody to care.
Female 2:Maybe you're afraid you'll make it worse if you ask. Like you'll put the idea in their head.
Male 3:Believe me, it doesn't work that way.
Female 1:It doesn't hurt to ask.
Female 3:In fact, the best way to keep a teenager from killing herself is to ask, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"
Male 1:And what if they say "yes"
Female 2:or "maybe"
Male 2:or "sometimes?"
Female 3:Well, here's what youdon'tsay,
Male 3:"That's crazy."
Female 2:"Don't be such a drama queen."
Male 3:"You're making too much of this."
Female 1:"That boy's not worth killing yourself over."
Female 3:"It's not going to solve anything."
Male 1:"You're just trying to get attention."
Male 2:"You're not going to kill yourself."
Male 3:What youdosay is
Female 2:"I'm sorry you're feeling so bad."
Female 1:"How can I help?"
Female 3:"We'll get through this together."
Male 1:"Let's keep you safe."
Male 2:A lot of people think about killing themselves, adults and kids.
Male 3:Most of them never tried but some of them do, so if your kid says,
Female 2:"I'd be better off dead."
Female 3:"I can't live with this."
Male 3:"I'm gonna kill myself."
Male 2:take her seriously. Find someone she can talk to about it. Someone who knows how to help.
Female 2:Sometimes kids want to kill themselves because something happened--a breakup, a failure,
Female 1:but sometimes it goes deeper and it's not going to go away by itself.
Female 3:Get some help. Talk to your doctor,
Male 2:or a counselor at school,
Male 1:or your minister,
Male 3:but don't just let it drop,
Female 1:and make sure that your kid always has someone to turn to. Someone he trusts.
Female 3:Make a list together. Write down three, four, five names
Male 1:and put a suicide hotline number on there, too.
Male 3:Have him keep that list in his wallet so he always knows where to turn.
Female 3:Make sure your home is safe.
Female 2:If you have pills she could use to hurt herself, lock them up.
Male 2:If you have a gun, don't just lock it up. Get it out of the house, the bullets too.
Male 1:And one more thing, if you think your kid might be about to hurt himself, don't leave him alone.
Female 1:Take him to the emergency room.
Male 3:Call 9-1-1 if you have to.
Male 1:We all have our ups and downs but sometimes it's more than that.
Female 3:If you think something's wrong, the only way to find out is to ask.
Female 2:Ask straight-out, "Are you thinking about killing yourself?"
Male 2:Don't wait until you're sure. Trust your gut.
Male 3:Because it never hurts to ask
Female 1:and it can make a big difference,
Female 2:all the difference
Female 3:in your kid's life.

[Song lyrics]
I know what it feels like to say I'm so cold. One without the other. Lost in that hole. Don't think you are all alone. You have somewhere to go. This ain't a one-person show. Let someone out there lend you a hand. Don't go through this alone.
Reach Out. Give someone a chance to help even when you are falling down, down, down. Your whole life will turn around. Reach out to somebody. Give your hand to somebody. Life is in the palm of their hands.
Reach Out. Give someone a chance to help even when you are falling down, down, down. Your whole life will turn around. Reach out to somebody. Give your hand to somebody. Life is in the palm of their hands. Reach out to them. Reach out to them. Reach out to them.

Complications
Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide take an emotional toll. For instance, you may be so consumed by suicidal thoughts that you can't function in your daily life. And while many attempted suicides are impulsive acts during a moment of crisis, they can leave you with permanent serious or severe injuries, such as organ failure or brain damage.
For those left behind after a suicide — people known as survivors of suicide — grief, anger, depression and guilt are common.
Prevention
To help keep yourself from feeling suicidal:
- Get the treatment you need.If you don't treat the underlying cause, your suicidal thoughts are likely to return. You may feel embarrassed to seek treatment for mental health problems, but getting the right treatment for depression, substance misuse or another underlying problem will make you feel better about life — and help keep you safe.
- Establish your support network.It may be hard to talk about suicidal feelings, and your friends and family may not fully understand why you feel the way you do. Reach out anyway, and make sure the people who care about you know what's going on and are there when you need them. You may also want to get help from your place of worship, support groups or other community resources. Feeling connected and supported can help reduce suicide risk.
- Remember, suicidal feelings are temporary.If you feel hopeless or that life's not worth living anymore, remember that treatment can help you regain your perspective — and life will get better. Take one step at a time and don't act impulsively.
