Overview
Female sexual dysfunction is a medical term for ongoing sexual problems that upset you or your partner. Problems may involve sexual response, desire, orgasm or pain during sex.
Many people have sexual problems at some point. Some have them throughout their lives. Female sexual dysfunction can happen at any stage of life. It can happen only sometimes or all the time during sex.
Sexual response is complex. It involves how your body works, your feelings, things that happen in your life, your beliefs, your lifestyle and how you relate to your partner. A problem in any one of these areas can affect sexual desire, arousal or satisfaction. Treatment often involves more than one approach.

Causes
Sexual dysfunction problems often start when hormones change. This might be after having a baby or during menopause. Major illness, such as cancer, diabetes or heart disease, also can add to sexual dysfunction.
Factors that add to sex problems include the following:
- Physical.Medical conditions can lead to sexual dysfunction. These may include cancer, diabetes, kidney failure, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and bladder problems. Certain medicines can decrease your sexual desire and make it harder for you to have an orgasm. These include some medicines to treat depression, high blood pressure, allergies and cancers.
- Hormonal.Lower estrogen levels after menopause may lead to changes in your genital tissues and how you respond to sex. Lower estrogen leads to less blood flow to the pelvis. This can cause you to have less feeling in your genitals and to need more time to become aroused and reach orgasm.The vaginal lining also becomes thinner and less stretchy. Not being sexually active can make this worse. These factors can lead to painful intercourse, called dyspareunia. Sexual desire also lessens when hormone levels drop.Your body's hormone levels shift after giving birth and during breastfeeding. This can lead to vaginal dryness and affect your desire for sex.
- Psychological and social.Anxiety or depression that isn't treated can cause sexual dysfunction or add to it. So can long-term stress, a history of sexual abuse, worries of pregnancy and the demands of having an infant.Problems with your partner can affect your sex life. So can cultural and religious issues and problems with body image.
