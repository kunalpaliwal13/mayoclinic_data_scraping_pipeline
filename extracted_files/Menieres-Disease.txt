Overview
Meniere's disease is an inner ear problem that can cause dizzy spells, also called vertigo, and hearing loss. Most of the time, Meniere's disease affects only one ear.
Meniere's disease can happen at any age. But it usually starts between the ages of 40 to 60. It's thought to be a lifelong condition. But some treatments can help ease symptoms and lessen how it affects your life long term.

Causes
The cause of Meniere's disease isn't known. Symptoms of Meniere's disease may be due to extra fluid in the inner ear called endolymph. But it isn't clear what causes this fluid to build up in the inner ear.
Issues that affect the fluid, which might lead to Meniere's disease, include:
- Poor fluid drainage. This may be due to a blockage or irregular ear shape.
- Autoimmune disorders.
- Viral infection.
- Genetics.
Because no single cause has been found, Meniere's disease likely has a combination of causes.
Risk factors
Meniere's disease is most common in people ages 40 to 60. Females may have a slightly higher risk than men.
You may have a higher chance of getting Meniere's disease if someone in your family has had the condition.
You may have a higher risk of Meniere's disease if you have an autoimmune disorder.
Complications
The most difficult complications of Meniere's disease can be:
- Unexpected vertigo attacks.
- Possibly losing your hearing long term.
The disease can happen at any time. This can cause worry and stress.
Vertigo can cause you to lose balance. This can increase your risk of falls and accidents.
