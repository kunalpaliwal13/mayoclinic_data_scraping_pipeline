Bedbugs
- Symptoms &causes
- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Bedbugs are small, reddish-brown blood-sucking, wingless insects. Bedbug bites usually clear up without treatment in a week or two. Bedbugs aren't known to spread disease, but they can cause an allergic reaction or a severe skin reaction in some people.
Bedbugs are about the size of an apple seed. They hide in the cracks and crevices of beds, box springs, headboards, bed frames and other objects around a bed and come out at night to feed on their preferred host, humans. The risk of running into bedbugs is higher if you spend time in places where nighttime guests come and go often â€” such as hotels, hospitals or homeless shelters.
If you have bedbugs in your home, professional extermination is recommended.

- Headboards
- Objects near beds
They can also be found:

How do they spread?
Bedbugs can move from one site to another by traveling on items such as clothing, luggage, furniture, boxes and bedding.
Bedbugs can easily travel between floors and rooms in hotels or apartment buildings.
Sign of uncleanliness?
Bedbugs don't care if their environment is clean or dirty. All they need is a warm host and plenty of hiding places.
Risk factors
You're at risk of bites from bedbugs if you're in places where people come and go often, such as apartment buildings, dorm rooms, homeless shelters, hotels, cruise ships, trains, buses and refugee camps.
Prevention
- Cover up.Bedbugs don't tend to burrow under clothing. So you may be able to avoid bites by wearing pajamas that cover as much skin as possible.
- Inspect secondhand items.Look over used bedding, mattresses and upholstered furniture before bringing them into your home.
- Use hotel precautions.Check mattress seams for bedbug excrement and place your luggage on tables or dressers instead of on the floor.
