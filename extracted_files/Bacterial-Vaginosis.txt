Overview
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) can cause discomfort and pain of the vagina. It happens when natural bacteria levels are out of balance. Balanced levels of bacteria help keep the vagina healthy. But when too much of some bacteria grow, it can lead to.
Bacterial vaginosis can happen at any age. But it's most common during the reproductive years. The changes in hormones during this time make it easier for certain kinds of bacteria to grow. Also, bacterial vaginosis is more common among those who are sexually active. It's not clear why this is. But activities such as unprotected sex and douching raise your risk of having.

Causes
Bacterial vaginosis happens when the vagina's natural bacteria levels are out of balance. The bacteria in the vagina are called the vaginal flora. Balanced vaginal flora help keep the vagina healthy. Usually "good" bacteria outnumber "bad" bacteria. The good bacteria are called lactobacilli; the bad bacteria are anaerobes. When there are too many anaerobes, they upset the balance of the flora, causing bacterial vaginosis.
Risk factors
Risk factors for bacterial vaginosis include:
- Having different sex partners or a new sex partner.The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn't clear. Buthappens more often when someone has different or new sex partners. Also,is more common when the sex of both partners is female.
- Douching.The vagina is self-cleaning. So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn't needed. It may even cause problems. Douching upsets the vagina's healthy balance of bacteria. It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis.
- Natural lack of lactobacilli bacteria.If your vagina doesn't produce enough lactobacilli, you're more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis.
Complications
Bacterial vaginosis doesn't cause complications very often. But sometimes, havingmay lead to:
- Sexually transmitted infections.If you have, you have a higher risk of getting an.s include, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia or gonorrhea. If you have, bacterial vaginosis raises the risk of passing the virus to your partner.
- Infection risk after gynecological surgery.Havingmay increase the risk of developing an infection after surgery such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage (D&C).
- Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause. This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility.
- Pregnancy issues.Past studies have shown a possible link betweenand problems with pregnancy. These include preterm birth and low birth weight. New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons. These reasons include having a history of early delivery. But the studies agree that you should be tested if you notice symptoms ofwhile pregnant. If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you.
Prevention
To help prevent bacterial vaginosis:
- Don't use scented products.Wash your genitals with warm water only. Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues. Use unscented tampons or pads only.
- Don't douche.Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection. It may even make it worse. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than normal bathing. Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection.
- Practice safe sex.To lower your risk ofs, use latex condoms or dental dams. Clean any sex toys. Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex.
