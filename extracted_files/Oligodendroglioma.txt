Oligodendroglioma
- Symptoms &causes
- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Oligodendroglioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The growth, called a tumor, begins in cells called oligodendrocytes. These cells make a substance that protects nerve cells and helps with the flow of electrical signals in the brain and spinal cord.
Oligodendroglioma is most common in adults, but it can happen at any age. Symptoms include seizures, headaches, and weakness or disability in a part of the body. Where this happens in the body depends on which parts of the brain or spinal cord are affected by the tumor.
Treatment is with surgery, when possible. Sometimes surgery can't be done if the tumor is in a place that makes it hard to reach with surgical tools. Other treatments may be needed if the tumor can't be removed or if it's likely to come back after surgery.

Causes
The cause of oligodendroglioma often isn't known. This tumor starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. It forms in cells called oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes help protect nerve cells and help with the flow of electrical signals in the brain.
Oligodendroglioma happens when oligodendrocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The tumor cells form a growth that may press on nearby parts of the brain or spinal cord as the growth gets bigger. Sometimes the DNA changes turn the tumor cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
Risk factors
Risk factors for oligodendroglioma include:
- History of radiation exposure.A history of radiation to the head and neck can increase a person's risk.
- Adult age.This tumor can happen at any age. But it's more often found in adults in their 40s and 50s.
- White race.Oligodendroglioma happens most often in white people who don't have Hispanic ancestry.
There is no way to prevent oligodendroglioma.
