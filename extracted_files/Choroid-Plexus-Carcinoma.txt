Overview
Choroid plexus carcinoma is a rare type of brain cancer that happens mainly in children.
Choroid plexus carcinoma begins as a growth of cells in the part of the brain called the choroid plexus. Cells in the choroid plexus produce the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid, also known as CSF. As the cancer grows, it can cause too much CSF in the brain. This can lead to symptoms such as irritability, nausea or vomiting, and headaches.
Treatment and chance of recovery depend on many factors. These include the cancer's size, location, whether it has spread, and your child's age and general health.

Causes
It's not clear what causes most choroid plexus carcinomas. This cancer starts as a growth of cells in the brain.
Choroid plexus carcinoma happens when cells in the brain develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue.
Risk factors
Factors that increase the risk of choroid plexus carcinoma include:
- Young age.Choroid plexus carcinoma can happen at any age. This brain cancer happens most often in children under 2 years old.
- Inherited syndromes.Some choroid plexus carcinomas are linked to certain genetic changes that can run in families, such as with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
