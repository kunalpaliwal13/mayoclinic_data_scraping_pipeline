Overview
An arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. This disrupts blood flow and prevents tissues from receiving oxygen. Ancan occur anywhere in the body, including in the brain.
Arteries move oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain and other organs. Veins drain the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. When andisrupts this critical process, surrounding tissues might not get enough oxygen.
Because the tangled blood vessels in ando not form properly, they can weaken and burst. If anin the brain bursts, it can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to a stroke or brain damage. Bleeding in the brain is known as a hemorrhage.

One type ofcalled a vein of Galen malformation causes symptoms that appear at or shortly after birth. A vein of Galen malformation occurs deep inside the brain. Signs can include:
- A buildup of fluid in the brain that causes the head to be larger than usual.
- Swollen veins on the scalp.
- Seizures.
- Failure to thrive.
- Congestive heart failure.

Causes
An arteriovenous malformation happens when arteries and veins connect in an irregular way. Experts don't understand why this happens. Certain genetic changes might play a role, but most types are not usually passed down in families.
Risk factors
Rarely, having a family history of an arteriovenous malformation can increase your risk. But most types aren't inherited.
Certain hereditary conditions can increase your risk of an arteriovenous malformation. These include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.
Complications
The most common complications of an arteriovenous malformation are bleeding and seizures. Bleeding can cause brain damage and may cause death if you don't get treated.
