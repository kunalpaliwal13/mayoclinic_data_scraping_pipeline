Phenylketonuria (PKU)

- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Phenylketonuria (fen-ul-key-toe-NU-ree-uh), also called PKU, is a rare inherited disorder that causes an amino acid called phenylalanine to build up in the body.is caused by a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene. This gene helps create the enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine.
Without the enzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine, a dangerous buildup can develop when a person witheats foods that contain protein or eats aspartame, an artificial sweetener. This can eventually lead to serious health problems.
For the rest of their lives, people with— babies, children and adults — need to follow a diet that limits phenylalanine, which is found mostly in foods that contain protein. Newer medications may allow some people withto eat a diet that has a higher or an unrestricted amount of phenylalanine.
Babies in the United States and many other countries are screened forsoon after birth. Although there is no cure for, recognizingand starting treatment right away can help prevent limitations in areas of thinking, understanding and communicating (intellectual disability) and major health problems.

Symptoms
Newborns withinitially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs ofwithin a few months.
Signs and symptoms of untreatedcan be mild or severe and may include:
- A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body
- Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures
- Skin rashes, such as eczema
- Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone
- Unusually small head size (microcephaly)
- Hyperactivity
- Intellectual disability
- Delayed development
- Behavioral, emotional and social problems
- Mental health disorders
Severity varies
The severity ofdepends on the type.
- Classic.The most severe form of the disorder is called classic. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage.
- Lesssevere forms of.In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage.
Regardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a specialdiet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications.
Pregnancy and PKU
Women who haveand become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal. If women don't follow the specialdiet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby.
Even women with less severe forms ofmay place their unborn children at risk by not following thediet.
Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit. But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have:
- Low birth weight
- Unusually small head
- Problems with the heart
In addition, maternalcan cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior.
When to see a doctor
Talk to your health care provider in these situations:
- Newborns.If routine newborn screening tests show that your baby may have, your child's health care provider will want to start dietary treatment right away to prevent long-term problems.
- Women of childbearing years.It's especially important for women with a history ofto see a health care provider and maintain thediet before becoming pregnant and during pregnancy. This reduces the risk of high blood phenylalanine levels harming their unborn babies.
- Adults.People withneed to receive lifelong care. Adults withwho have stopped thediet in their teens may benefit from a visit with their health care providers. Returning to the diet may improve mental functioning and behavior and prevent further damage to the central nervous system that can result from high phenylalanine levels.

Causes
A gene change (genetic mutation) causes, which can be mild, moderate or severe. In a person with, a change in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene causes a lack of or reduced amount of the enzyme that's needed to process phenylalanine, an amino acid.
A dangerous buildup of phenylalanine can develop when a person witheats protein-rich foods, such as milk, cheese, nuts or meat, or grains such as bread and pasta, or aspartame, an artificial sweetener.
Inheritance
For a child to inherit, both the mother and father must have and pass on the changed gene. This pattern of inheritance is called autosomal recessive.
It's possible for a parent to be a carrier — to have the changed gene that causes, but not have the disease. If only one parent has the changed gene, there's no risk of passingto a child, but it's possible for the child to be a carrier.
Most often,is passed to children by two parents who are both carriers of the changed gene, but don't know it.
Risk factors
Risk factors for inheritinginclude:
- Having both parents with a gene change that causes.Two parents must pass along a copy of the changed gene for their child to develop the condition.
- Being of a certain racial or ethnic descent.affects people from most ethnic backgrounds worldwide. But in the United States, it's most common in people of European ancestry and much less common in people of African ancestry.
Complications
Untreatedcan lead to complications in infants, children and adults with the disorder. When women withhave high blood phenylalanine levels during pregnancy, it can harm their unborn baby.
Untreatedcan lead to:
- Irreversible brain damage and marked intellectual disability beginning within the first few months of life
- Neurological problems such as seizures and tremors
- Behavioral, emotional and social problems in older children and adults
- Major health and developmental problems
Prevention
If you haveand are considering getting pregnant:
- Follow a low-phenylalanine diet.Women withcan prevent harm to their developing baby by sticking to or returning to a low-phenylalanine diet before becoming pregnant. Nutritional supplements designed for people withcan ensure enough protein and nutrition during pregnancy. If you have, talk to your health care provider before you start trying to conceive.
- Consider genetic counseling.If you have, a close relative withor a child with, you may benefit from genetic counseling before becoming pregnant. A specialist in medical genetics (geneticist) can help you better understand howis passed through your family. The specialist can also help determine your risk of having a child withand assist with family planning.
