Overview
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a health issue that becomes more common with age. It's also called an enlarged prostate. The prostate is a small gland that helps make semen. It's found just below the bladder. And it often gets bigger as you get older.
An enlarged prostate can cause symptoms that may bother you, such as blocking the flow of urine out of the bladder. It also can cause bladder, urinary tract or kidney problems.
Many treatments can help. These include medicines, surgery and other procedures. Your health care provider can help you choose. The right option depends on things such as:
- Your symptoms.
- The size of your prostate.
- Other health problems you might have.

Causes
The prostate gland is located beneath the bladder. The tube that moves urine from the bladder out of the penis is called the urethra. This tube passes through the center of the prostate. When the prostate gets bigger, it starts to block urine flow.
The prostate is a gland that typically keeps growing throughout life. This growth often enlarges the prostate enough to cause symptoms or to block urine flow.
It isn't clear what causes the prostate to get bigger. It might be due to changes in the balance of sex hormones as you grow older.
Risk factors
Risk factors for an enlarged prostate include:
- Aging.An enlarged prostate gland rarely causes symptoms before age 40. After that, the chance of having an enlarged prostate and related symptoms starts to rise.
- Family history.Having a blood relative with prostate problems makes you more likely to have problems with your prostate.
- Diabetes and heart disease.Studies show that diabetes might raise the risk of. So might heart disease.
- Lifestyle.Obesity raises the risk of. Exercise can help lower the risk.
Complications
Complications of an enlarged prostate can include:
- Not being able to pee.This also is called urinary retention. You might need to have a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder to drain the urine. Some people with an enlarged prostate need surgery to get relief.
- Urinary tract infections (UTIs).Not being able to fully empty the bladder can raise the risk of infection in the urinary tract. If you often get, you might need surgery to remove part of the prostate.
- Bladder stones.These are most often caused by being unable to fully empty the bladder. Bladder stones can cause illness, bladder irritation, blood in the urine and blocked urine flow.
- Bladder damage.A bladder that doesn't empty fully can stretch and weaken over time. As a result, the muscular wall of the bladder no longer squeezes properly to force urine out. And this makes it harder to fully empty the bladder.
- Kidney damage.Pressure in the bladder from not being able to pee can damage the kidneys or let bladder infections reach the kidneys.
Treatment forlowers the risk of these complications. But urinary retention and kidney damage can be serious health threats.
Having an enlarged prostate is not thought to raise the risk of getting prostate cancer.
