Overview
Burkitt lymphoma is a type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is cancer that affects the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is made up of organs, glands, tubelike vessels and clusters of cells called lymph nodes. It's part of the body's germ-fighting immune system.
There are many types of lymphoma. Lymphoma types are often divided into two categories: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Burkitt lymphoma starts in a type of germ-fighting white blood cell called B cells, also called B lymphocytes. In Burkitt lymphoma, changes happen that turn the B lymphocytes into cancer cells. The cancer cells can grow in the lymph nodes, jaw or other bones in the face, parts of the intestines, bone marrow, central nervous system, and other areas of the body.
Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive type of cancer, but it may be cured when diagnosed and treated right away. Treatment for Burkitt lymphoma often includes a combination of chemotherapy medicines. Other treatments may include immunotherapy, clinical trials, bone marrow transplant, also called a bone marrow stem cell transplant, and radiation therapy.
Types
The types of Burkitt lymphoma include:
- Endemic.This type of Burkitt lymphoma is most commonly found in Africa, New Guinea and parts of South America. It is more common in children, especially boys. Nearly everyone with endemic Burkitt lymphoma also has Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This common virus often causes symptoms like those of a cold. This type of Burkitt lymphoma often causes growths, called tumors, in the jaw, facial bones or eye area. It also can affect other parts of the body such as the thyroid, kidneys and ovaries.
- Sporadic.This type of Burkitt lymphoma is more commonly found in the United States and parts of Europe. It is more common in children, especially boys. This type usually involves a part of the belly where the small intestine and large intestine meet. Other parts of the body affected may include the lymph nodes, central nervous system, ovaries, kidneys and breasts. Some people with sporadic Burkitt lymphoma have had Epstein-Barr virus in the past. But most cases of this type aren't linked to this infection.
- Immunodeficiency-associated.This type of Burkitt lymphoma often happens in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This type also can happen in people taking immunosuppressants after organ transplant. This type is mostly in the lymph nodes, but it also can affect the bone marrow and central nervous system.
The term "Burkitt leukemia" may be used to describe Burkitt lymphoma that is found in the blood and bone marrow.
Symptoms
Burkitt lymphoma signs and symptoms may include:
- A fast-growing tumor in the lymph nodes or other parts of the body, such as the jaw.
- Painless swelling in the neck, armpit or groin.
- Fatigue.
- Fever.
- Night sweats.
- Losing weight without trying.
- Feeling full quickly.
Burkitt lymphoma can happen in the part of the belly where the large intestine and small intestine meet. This is known as the ileocecal region. When this region is affected, symptoms may include:
- A fast-growing tumor in the belly.
- Pain or fullness in the belly.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Loss of appetite.
- Losing weight without trying.
If Burkitt lymphoma is present in the brain and spinal cord, it may cause neurological symptoms such as headaches, confusion, vision changes and more.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.
Causes
It's not clear what causes Burkitt lymphoma. This cancer starts in a type of white blood cell that fights infections, called a B cell, also known as a B lymphocyte. In Burkitt lymphoma, gene changes cause the cell's DNA to rearrange. This is known as translocation. Translocation causes the B lymphocytes to turn into cancer cells. The cancer cells can build up in different areas of the body and cause tumors.
Risk factors
Factors that can increase the risk of Burkitt lymphoma include:
- Age.Endemic and sporadic Burkitt lymphomas are more common in children.
- Certain infections.Certain infections can increase the risk of developing Burkitt lymphoma. These include Epstein-Barr virus, HIV and malaria.
- A weakened immune system.Having a condition that affects the immune system can increase the risk of Burkitt lymphoma. Conditions may include ataxia-telangiectasia, Duncan syndrome, and X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect, EBV infection and neoplasia (XMEN). The immune system also may be weakened after organ transplant.
- A family history of lymphoma.Having a relative with lymphoma may increase your risk of Burkitt lymphoma.
Complications
A complication of Burkitt lymphoma is the risk of the cancer coming back. Even after successful treatment, Burkitt lymphoma may come back. This is called a relapse. The risk of relapse is higher in people with cancer of the central nervous system. For people who have relapsed, the prognosis is much worse.
