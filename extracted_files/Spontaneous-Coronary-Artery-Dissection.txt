Overview
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is an emergency condition that occurs when a tear forms in a wall of a heart artery. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection also is called.
can slow or block blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack, heart rhythm problems or sudden death.
most commonly affects women in their 40s and 50s, though it can occur at any age and can occur in men. People who haveoften don't have risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.
can cause sudden death if it isn't treated promptly. Get emergency medical help if you have heart attack symptoms â€” even if you think you aren't at risk of a heart attack.
A tear develops on the inside of a coronary artery, allowing blood to create a split between two layers of the wall. This may result in a loose flap of tissue on the inside of the artery. Sometimes, the split remains small, but the blood in between the layers can clot. This clot, called an intramural hematoma, may cause the normal artery channel to become narrow, blocking blood flow to the heart.

- Extreme stress.can happen after extreme stress. This includes intense physical exercise and severe emotional distress.
- Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD).This condition causes weakening of the body's medium-sized arteries.may lead to artery problems such as aneurysm or dissection. Women are more likely to have it than men.
- Genetic conditions affecting connective tissue.Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan syndromes have been found to occur in people who have had.
- Very high blood pressure.Severe high blood pressure can raise the risk of.
- Illegal drug use.Using cocaine or other illegal drugs might increase the risk of.
Complications
A possible complication ofis heart attack.slows or stops blood flow through an artery. This weakens the heart and may lead to a heart attack. A heart attack fromis different from a heart attack caused by a buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls. This condition is called atherosclerosis.
In some people with, the inner and outer layers of the artery may split. Blood can collect between these layers. Pressure from the pooled blood can makeworse.
Even with successful treatment,can happen more than once. It might happen soon after the first episode or years later. People who havealso may have a higher risk of other heart problems. These problems include heart failure due to the heart attack damage.
