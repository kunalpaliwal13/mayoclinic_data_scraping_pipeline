Swimmer's itch

- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Swimmer's itch is a rash that can occur after you go swimming or wading outdoors. It's most common after being in freshwater lakes and ponds, but you can get it in saltwater too.
Swimmer's itch is usually caused by a reaction to tiny parasites in the water that burrow into your skin while you're swimming or wading in warm, calm water. These parasites can't survive in people, so they soon die.
Swimmer's itch usually clears on its own within a few days. In the meantime, you can control itching with medicine.

Symptoms
Swimmer's itch symptoms include an itchy rash that looks like pimples or blisters. Symptoms may begin within minutes or as long as two days after swimming or wading in contaminated water.
Usually the rash affects skin that's not covered by swimsuits, wetsuits or waders. Your sensitivity to swimmer's itch can increase each time you're exposed to the parasites that cause it.
When to see a doctor
Talk to your health care provider if you have a rash after swimming that lasts more than a week. If you notice pus at the rash site, check with your health care provider. You might be referred to a doctor who specializes in skin conditions (dermatologist).
Causes
Swimmer's itch is caused by an allergic reaction to parasites that burrow into your skin from warm water. These parasites are found in some animals that live near ponds and lakes, including geese, ducks and muskrats.
The parasites' eggs get into the water through the animals' waste. When the young parasites hatch, they live and grow in a type of snail that lives in shallow water. The snails then release the parasites into the water, where they can infect humans.
Swimmer's itch isn't contagious from person to person.
Risk factors
Factors that can increase the risk of swimmer's itch include:
- Spending time in water that's infested with certain parasites.
- Forgetting to dry off with a towel after getting out of the water.
- Being sensitive to the parasites that cause swimmer's itch.
Complications
Swimmer's itch usually isn't serious, but your skin can become infected if you scratch the rash.
