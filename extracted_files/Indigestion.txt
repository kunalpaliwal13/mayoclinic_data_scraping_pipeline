Overview
Indigestion is discomfort or pain in the belly. Symptoms may include a burning pain, feeling full while eating or feeling full long after eating. Indigestion symptoms may happen once in a while or often.
Indigestion may be caused by a digestive system condition. But often, there is no clear underlying cause. Frequent or long-lasting indigestion often can be treated with changes in diet and lifestyle, mental health therapy, and medicines.
Indigestion also is called upset stomach or dyspepsia.

Many factors may contribute to or worsen functional indigestion. These include:
- Overeating or eating too quickly.
- Fatty, greasy or spicy foods.
- Caffeine, alcohol or carbonated beverages.
- Acidic foods, such as tomatoes and oranges.
- Anxiety, depression or trauma.
- Smoking.
- Certain antibiotics and pain relievers.
H. pylori bacteria can cause ulcers in the stomach or small intestine. H. pylori may contribute to indigestion even if it has not caused an ulcer.
