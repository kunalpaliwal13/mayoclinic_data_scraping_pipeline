Overview
Central nervous system vascular malformations are rare issues with the blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord and their coverings, called membranes.
There are several types of central nervous system vascular malformations, including:
- Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).These are unusual tangles of blood vessels that connect arteries and veins.can be anywhere in the body. Most often they occur in or near the brain or the spine. This type poses the highest risk of brain bleeds and other complications.
- Capillary telangiectasias.These are small blood vessels, called capillaries, that are wider than usual.
- Cavernous malformations.These are blood vessels in the brain or spinal cord that are formed unusually. They look like mulberries or popcorn.
- Dural arteriovenous fistulas.These are unusual links between arteries and the tough covering over the brain or spinal cord, called dura, and a draining vein.
- Venous malformations.These are unusually enlarged veins in the brain or spinal cord. They also are called developmental venous anomalies.

Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the type of central nervous system vascular malformation and where it's found. Some vascular malformations have no symptoms. They're found on imaging for something else.
Symptoms for some central nervous system vascular malformations can include:
- Bleeding.
- Seizures.
- Headache.
- Brain and nervous system problems, called neurological deficits, that get worse over time. Neurological deficits can affect speech, vision, balance, memory and other abilities.
Causes
The cause of central nervous system vascular malformations is unclear. Some are present at birth, called congenital. Others come later.
Some genetic conditions can increase the risk of having vascular malformation. Injury to the central nervous system might be another cause.
Complications
Central nervous system vascular malformations can damage the brain or spinal cord. Damage can come from bleeding, called hemorrhage, into nearby tissues. Vascular malformations also can block oxygen flow to tissues and put pressure on parts of the brain or spinal cord.
Complications can include:
- Stroke.
- Brain damage from a burst blood vessel.
- Death.
- Learning and behavior problems in children.
Once bleeding occurs, there's a greater risk of having another bleed. For someone who has a vascular malformation, being pregnant might increase the risk of bleeding.
