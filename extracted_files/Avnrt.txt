Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT)
- Symptoms &causes
- Diagnosis &treatment
Overview
Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is a type of irregular heartbeat, also called an arrhythmia. It is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).
People with AVNRT have a very fast heartbeat that often starts and ends suddenly. In AVNRT, the heart beats more than 100 times a minute. The condition is due to a change in heart signaling.
AVNRT tends to occur more often in young women. But anyone can have it at any age. AVNRT may not need treatment. When treatment is needed, it may include specific actions or movements, medicines, or a heart procedure.

Symptoms
A very fast heartbeat is the most common symptom of atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT). In AVNRT, the heart can beat between 120 to 280 times a minute. The fast heartbeat usually starts suddenly.
AVNRT does not always cause symptoms. When symptoms do show up, they may include:
- A pounding feeling in the neck.
- Pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.
- Chest pressure, tightness or pain.
- Dizziness or lightheadedness.
- Shortness of breath.
- Sweating.
- Weakness or extreme tiredness.
- Fainting or almost fainting.
Symptoms of AVNRT may be mild in children. Some symptoms include sweating, trouble feeding, changes in skin color and a fast heartbeat.
When to see a doctor
Make an appointment for a healthcare checkup if you have unexplained changes in your heartbeat.
Also see a healthcare professional if an infant or child has these symptoms:
- Fast heartbeat.
- Sweating for no reason.
- Changes in feeding.
- Changes in skin color.
Call 911 or your local emergency number if you a very fast heartbeat that lasts for several minutes or happens with these symptoms:
- Chest pain.
- Dizziness.
- Trouble breathing.
- Weakness.
Causes
Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is caused by faulty electrical signaling in the heart. Electrical signals control the heartbeat.
Usually, electrical signals in the heart follow a specific pathway. In AVNRT, there is an extra signaling pathway, called a reentrant circuit. The extra pathway makes the heart beat too early. This stops the heart from pumping blood like it should.
Healthcare professionals aren't sure why some people have the extra pathway that causes AVNRT. Sometimes, changes in the heart's structure may cause it.
Risk factors
Atrioventricular nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) is more common in young women. But anyone can get it.
Some health conditions or treatments may increase the risk of AVNRT. These include:
- Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and other heart diseases.
- Heart failure.
- Heart condition present at birth, called a congenital heart defect.
- Previous heart, lung or throat surgery.
- Obstructive sleep apnea.
- Thyroid disease.
- Lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
- Diabetes that is not controlled.
- Some medicines, including those used to treat asthma, allergies and colds.
Other things that may increase the risk of AVNRT include:
- Emotional stress.
- Caffeine.
- Excessive alcohol use, which is defined as 15 or more drinks a week for men and eight or more drinks a week for women.
- Smoking and using nicotine.
- Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine.
Complications
Possible complications of AVNRT are:
- Worsening of existing heart disease.
- Sudden stopping of all heart activity, called sudden cardiac arrest.
