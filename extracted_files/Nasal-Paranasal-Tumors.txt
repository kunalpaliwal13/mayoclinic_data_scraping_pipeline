Overview
Nasal and paranasal tumors are growths that begin in and around the passageway within the nose. Nasal tumors begin in the main passageway within the nose, called the nasal cavity. Paranasal tumors begin in air-filled chambers around the nose, called the paranasal sinuses.
Some nasal and paranasal tumors aren't cancerous. These noncancerous tumors also are called benign tumors. They can grow to block the flow of air through the nose.
Other nasal and paranasal tumors are cancers. Cancerous tumors also are called malignant tumors. They can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body.
Several types of nasal and paranasal tumors exist. The type of tumor you have helps determine the best treatment for you.

When to see a doctor
Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you.
Causes
Nasal and paranasal tumors happen when cells in the nasal cavity or chambers around the nose develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions also tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to make many more cells quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells.
Sometimes the changes in the DNA turn the cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer.
Risk factors
Factors that may increase the risk of nasal and paranasal tumors include:
- Smoking tobacco increases the risk.This includes cigarettes, cigars and pipes.
- Being exposed to air pollution.Breathing in polluted air increases the risk of nasal and paranasal tumors.
- Being exposed to chemicals and irritants in the air at work.These may include wood dust, fumes from glue, rubbing alcohol and formaldehyde, and dust from flour, chromium and nickel.
- Being exposed to human papillomavirus, also called.is a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. For most people, it causes no problems and goes away on its own. For others, it causes changes in cells that can lead to many types of cancer.
Prevention

- Stop smoking.If you don't use tobacco, don't start. If you currently use tobacco of any kind, talk with a healthcare professional about strategies to help you quit.
- Protect yourself at work.Follow your workplace safety rules for protecting yourself from harmful fumes and irritants in the air, such as wearing a face mask.
