Overview
Adrenoleukodystrophy (uh-dree-noh-loo-koh-DIS-truh-fee) is a type of hereditary (genetic) condition that damages the membrane (myelin sheath) that insulates nerve cells in your brain.
In adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), your body can't break down very long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), causing saturateds to build up in your brain, nervous system and adrenal gland.
The most common type ofis X-linked, which is caused by a genetic defect on the X chromosome. X-linkedaffects males more severely than females, who carry the disease.
Forms of X-linkedinclude:
- Childhood-onset.This form of X-linkedusually occurs between ages 4 and 10. The white matter of the brain is progressively damaged (leukodystrophy), and symptoms worsen over time. If not diagnosed early, childhood-onsetmay lead to death within five to 10 years.
- Addison's disease.Hormone-producing glands (adrenal glands) often fail to produce enough steroids (adrenal insufficiency) in people who have, causing a form of X-linkedknown as Addison's disease.
- Adrenomyeloneuropathy.This adult-onset form of X-linkedis a less severe and slowly progressive form that causes symptoms such as a stiff gait and bladder and bowel dysfunction. Women who are carriers formay develop a mild form of adrenomyeloneuropathy.
