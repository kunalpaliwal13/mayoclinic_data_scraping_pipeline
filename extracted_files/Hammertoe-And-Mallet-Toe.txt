When to see a doctor

Causes
Hammertoe and mallet toe have been linked to:
- Certain shoes.High-heeled shoes or footwear that's too tight in the toe can crowd toes so they can't lie flat. In time, the toe might remain curled even when not in shoes.
- Injury.A toe that has been stubbed, jammed or broken might be more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe.
- Toe muscles that are out of balance.If the muscles aren't balanced, they can put pressure on the tendons and joints. This change in balance can lead to hammertoe and mallet toe over time.
Risk factors
Factors that can increase the risk of hammertoe and mallet toe include:
- Sex assigned a birth.Women are more likely to develop hammertoe or mallet toe than are men.
- Certain diseases.Arthritis and diabetes can increase the risk of having foot problems. Genes also might play a role.
Complications
For a while, you still might be able to straighten the toe. But over time, the tendons and joints of a hammertoe or mallet toe might tighten. This can cause the toe to stay bent.
Shoes can rub against the higher part of the bent toe. The bent position also may lead to excess pressure on the toe bones. This can cause painful corns or calluses.
Prevention
Shoes that fit well can prevent many foot, heel and ankle problems. Here's what to look for when buying shoes:
- Enough toe room.Avoid shoes with pointed toes.
- Low heels.Not wearing high heels can help prevent toe and back problems.
- Shoes that adjust.Shoes with laces or straps are roomier and easier to make comfortable feeling.
These added tips can help you buy the right shoes:
- Shop at the end of the day.Feet swell as the day goes on.
- Check size.Shoe size — especially the width — can change with age. Measure both feet and buy for the larger foot.
- Buy shoes that fit right away.Be sure shoes are comfortable before you buy them. A shoe repair store might be able to stretch shoes in tight spots, but it's better to buy them to fit.
