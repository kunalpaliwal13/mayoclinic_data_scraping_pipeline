Overview
Sleep disorders are conditions that change the way you sleep. If you have a sleep disorder, you may not get enough sleep or you may not feel rested when you wake up. You may be very sleepy during the daytime. You may have changes in breathing or move around a lot during sleep. Or you may have problems getting to sleep, staying asleep or waking too early.
A sleep disorder can affect your overall health, safety and quality of life. Not getting a good night's sleep can affect your ability to drive or work safely. It also can raise your risk of other health problems. But treatment can help you get the sleep you need.

Symptoms
Symptoms of common sleep disorders include:
- Being very sleepy during the daytime. You may fall asleep at times that aren't typical, such as while driving or while working at your desk.
- Trouble falling asleep, waking up during the night and not being able to go back to sleep. Or you may wake up too early.
- Breathing in a pattern that isn't typical. This may include snoring, snorting, gasping, choking or pausing during breathing.
- Feeling an urge to move that is not comfortable while you're trying to fall asleep. Your legs or arms may feel tingly or crawly.
- Moving too much or having movements that bother you during sleep, such as arm and leg movements or teeth grinding.
- Activities during sleep that are not usual, such as sleepwalking, sleep-eating or bed-wetting.
When to see a doctor
Anyone can have an occasional poor night's sleep. But talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you regularly have trouble getting enough sleep, if you don't feel rested when you wake up or if you feel overly sleepy during the day.
Causes
There are many different types of sleep disorders, and the causes vary widely. Sleep disorders are often grouped according to why they happen or their effects. Sleep disorders also can be grouped based on behaviors, problems with your natural sleep-wake cycles, breathing problems, difficulty sleeping or how sleepy you feel during the day.
Sometimes the exact cause is not known, but several factors can increase the risk of having a sleep disorder.
Risk factors
These issues can raise the risk of sleep disorders:
- Age.Sleep varies depending on age, and age may play a role in sleep disorders. Some sleep disorders, such as bed-wetting, may be more common in children. Other sleep disorders are more common with older age.
- Genetics.Having some sleep disorders, such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, sleepwalking, and sleep apnea, may be more likely if a family member also has them.
- Medical conditions.Brain and nerve conditions, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury, may raise the risk of sleep disorders. Heart disease, lung disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic pain are linked with insomnia. Being overweight raises the risk of obstructive sleep apnea. Heart failure and atrial fibrillation raise the risk of central sleep apnea.
- Mental health conditions.Stress, depression, anxiety and other mental health conditions may affect sleep.
- Schedule changes.Jet lag or shift work can change your sleep-wake cycle and disrupt sleep.
- Medicines and drugs.Certain medicines, caffeine, alcohol, and legal or illegal drugs that may be sold on the streets, also called recreational drugs, can affect sleep.
Complications
Untreated sleep disorders are linked with serious complications. These can include a higher risk or worsening of medical conditions such as heart disease, stroke and diabetes. Sleep disorders also can affect mental health. And ongoing insomnia can raise the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.
Sleep disorders can affect your quality of life. Excessive daytime sleepiness can make it hard to focus and pay attention. This can impact driving safety, workplace errors and how well you do in school.
