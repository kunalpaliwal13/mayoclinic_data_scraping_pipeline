Causes
Sexually transmitted infections can be caused by:
- Bacteria.Gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia are examples ofthat are caused by bacteria.
- Parasites.Trichomoniasis is ancaused by a parasite.
- Viruses.caused by viruses include human papillomavirus (HPV), the herpes simplex virus, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS.
Risk factors
Anyone who is sexually active risks getting or spreading an.
Factors that may increase the risk of getting an sexually transmitted infection include:
- Having unprotected sex.Vaginal or anal sex with an infected partner who isn't wearing a condom (latex or polyurethane) greatly increases the risk of getting an.  Condoms made from natural membranes aren't recommended because they're not effective at preventing somes. Not using condoms properly or not using them each time also can increase risk.Oral sex may be less risky. But sexually transmitted infections can still spread if a person doesn't use a condom (latex or polyurethane) or a dental dam. That is a thin, square piece of rubber made with latex or silicone.
- Having sexual contact with many partners.The more people you have sexual activity with, the greater your risk.
- Having a history ofs.Having one sexually transmitted infection makes it much easier for anotherto take hold.
- Being forced to engage in sexual activity.See a health care professional as soon as possible to get screening, treatment and emotional support.
- Misuse of alcohol or use of recreational drugs.Substance misuse can inhibit your judgment, making you more willing to take part in risky behaviors.
- Injecting drugs.Sharing a needle while injecting drugs can spread many serious infections. Examples are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
- Being young.People age 15 to 24 report high levels ofs compared to those who are older.

Spread from mothers to infants
During pregnancy or delivery, some sexually transmitted infections can be passed from mother to infant. Examples are gonorrhea, chlamydia,and syphilis.in infants can cause serious problems or even death. All pregnant women should be screened forinfections and treated as needed.
Complications
Many people in the early stages of anhave no symptoms. That's why screening is important to prevent complications.
Possible complications of sexually transmitted infections include:
- Pelvic pain.
- Pregnancy complications.
- Eye inflammation.
- Arthritis.
- Pelvic inflammatory disease.
- Infertility.
- Heart disease.
- Certain cancers, such as-associated cervical and rectal cancers.
Prevention
There are many ways to avoid or lower your risk of getting an.
- Avoid sex or sexual activity.The most effective way to avoidis to not have sex.
- Stay with one uninfected partner.Staying in a long-term relationship in which both people have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected can be one way to avoid an.
- Wait and test.Avoid vaginal and anal sex or sexual activity with new partners until you have both been tested for sexually transmitted infections. Oral sex may be less risky. Butcan still spread if a person doesn't use a condom (latex or polyurethane) or a dental dam. These barriers prevent skin-to-skin contact between the oral and genital mucous membranes.
- Get vaccinated.Getting vaccinated before having sex can prevent certain types of sexually transmitted infections. Vaccines are available to preventcaused by human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
- Use condoms and dental dams consistently and correctly.Use a new latex or polyurethane condom or dental dam for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, with a latex condom or dental dam. Also, these types of barriers give less protection forinvolving exposed genital sores, such asor herpes.Nonbarrier forms of contraception, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs), don't protect against.
- Don't drink alcohol excessively or use illegal drugs.If you're under the influence of these substances, you're more likely to take sexual risks.
- Talk to your partner.Before any sexual contact, talk to your partner about practicing safer sex. Be sure you clearly agree on what activities will and won't be OK.
- Think about male circumcision.For men, evidence has found that circumcision can help lower the risk of gettingfrom a woman withby as much as 60%. Male circumcision may also help prevent spread of genitaland genital herpes.
- Think about using preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP).The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two combination medicines to lower the risk ofinfection in people who are at very high risk. The medicines are emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Truvada) and emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (Descovy). These medicines must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed.
Use condoms and dental dams consistently and correctly.Use a new latex or polyurethane condom or dental dam for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly, with a latex condom or dental dam. Also, these types of barriers give less protection forinvolving exposed genital sores, such asor herpes.
Nonbarrier forms of contraception, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs), don't protect against.
Your health care professional will prescribe these medicines forprevention only if you don't already have. You'll need antest before you start takingand then every three months as long as you're taking it.
Your health care professional also will test your kidney function before prescribing Truvada. They will then test your kidney function every six months. If you have hepatitis B, see an infectious disease specialist or liver specialist before starting therapy.
According to the, if you use Truvada daily, you can lower your risk of gettingfrom sex by about 99%. And you can lower your risk of gettingfrom injection drug use by more than 74%.
Research suggests that Descovy is also effective in lowering the risk of gettingfrom sex. But Descovy hasn't been studied in people who have receptive vaginal sex. Using added prevention, such as condoms, can lower your risk even more and prevent other.
