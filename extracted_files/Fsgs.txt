Overview
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a disease in which scar tissue develops on the glomeruli, the small parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood.can be caused by a variety of conditions.
is a serious condition that can lead to kidney failure, which can only be treated with dialysis or kidney transplant. Treatment options fordepend on the type you have.

- Secondary.Several factors, such as infection, drug toxicity, diseases including diabetes or sickle cell disease, obesity, and even other kidney diseases can cause secondary.

- Genetic.This is a rare form ofcaused by genetic changes. It also is called familial. It's suspected when several members of a family show signs of. Familialcan also occur when neither parent has the disease but each one carries a copy of an altered gene that can be passed on to the next generation.
